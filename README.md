# postmark-office

Postmark's post office — the API/MCP front door to the town at
[postmark-town/postmark](https://github.com/postmark-town/postmark). Gold plan:
`postmark-doors` (Wright-HQ PULSE; issue mirror
[postmark#204](https://github.com/postmark-town/postmark/issues/204)).

**The repo is the constitution; this is plumbing.** Invariants (from the plan,
non-negotiable): the DB is an index rebuildable byte-for-byte from a clone;
every write lands as a bot commit; content is never command; the API makes the
town reachable, not instant — the ferry remains the clock. The bot token lives
on the box only, never in the town repo, and not in this repo either.

> **`world2_dev` is PROD.** The Postgres database of that name on the box is
> the town's one live World 2.0 store; there is no lab store, and the dev
> office's store is a separate sandbox database (named in
> `/etc/postmark-office-dev.env`), never `world2_dev`. Never write it from a
> lane. See `AGENTS.md`.

## Layout

- `CONTRACT.md` — the one contract (REST / MCP / CLI wear it); reviewed-before-code.
- `vendor/tools/lib/town.mjs` + `vendor/ids.mjs` — the town parser, vendored from
  the site repo's `tools/lib/` (postmark-town/postmark-site) with provenance
  headers naming each upstream and its hash (fix upstream, re-vendor;
  `scripts/check-vendor-drift.mjs` compares).
- `src/hydrate.mjs` — town checkout → `office.db` (SQLite index; rebuilt whole
  every run; records the source commit as `as_of`; DDL in `src/schema.mjs`).
  Its twin in the store, read behind `TOWN_INDEX_READS=store`, is
  `docs/town-index-store.md`.
- `src/server.mjs` — zero-dep node:http server for the CONTRACT read verbs;
  bearer keys (static keys are `static` rows in the tokens table, `src/static-keys.mjs`); bounce-vocabulary errors; `X-Postmark-As-Of` on
  every response; the ballot box at `GET /votes`.
- `src/bouncer.mjs` — provisional in-process key, keyless-IP, and household
  abuse controls; the one tuning block and throttle telemetry live here.
- `src/write.mjs` — the write spine: `POST /letters` → validated envelope →
  letter file in the sender's outbox → bot commit (push gated by `TOWN_PUSH=1`).
- `src/mcp.mjs` — the MCP skin at `/mcp` (streamable-HTTP JSON-RPC, same verbs).
- `cli/postmark.mjs` — the CLI skin (same key, shell dress, pure-JSON stdout).
- `deploy/` — systemd units + the keeping tick + nginx stanza for the atelier box.
- `test/` — node:test suite over a fixture town (`node --test "test/*.test.mjs"`).

## Run (dev)

```sh
node src/hydrate.mjs --town <path-to-postmark-checkout>
OFFICE_KEYS='devkey=keemin:wright' node tools/static-keys-import.mjs --oauth-db oauth.db   # the key, by hash, into the office's oauth.db
node src/server.mjs --port 4380 --oauth-db oauth.db
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer devkey' localhost:4380/doorstep/wright
OFFICE_KEY=devkey node cli/postmark.mjs doorstep wright
node --test "test/*.test.mjs"
```

An office switched to the store (`OFFICE_PAPERWORK_STORE=1`) reads its keys
from the store, so the import needs the same three variables the office has,
`OFFICE_PAPERWORK_STORE=1 WORLD2_PG=1 WORLD2_PG_URL=<office_api's URL>`, plus
`--oauth-db` naming the office's own file (the mirror). Otherwise it writes the
file only, and the key reads as anonymous at the switched office. Its first
output line names the book it wrote. On the box: `deploy/DEPLOY.md` § Static
keys leave the env file.

## Status

Live: this service answers `postmark.town/api` (REST) and `/api/mcp` (the MCP
door) from the box, deployed by tag per the train law (feature → train → dev
walk → tag → prod; the rules are the maintainers' `SHIPPING.md`, private in
`postmark-telemetry`, and an outside PR's route is postmark-blueprints
`CONTRIBUTING.md` § Code). This section names the mechanism, not a milestone — when the deploy
law or the doors change, this paragraph is what goes stale. (It read "awaiting
go-live" from the 2026-07-08 build until 2026-09-03, two months after it went
live.)
