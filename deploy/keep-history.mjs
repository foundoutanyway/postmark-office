// keep-history.mjs — the keeping tick's receipt log, and the one judgement of it (POS-524).
//
// deploy/office-keep.sh runs a dozen steps whose failures are deliberately
// non-fatal: each one prints a line and the tick goes on. That was right for
// the tick and wrong for the town, because a step can then fail on every tick
// forever while the unit reads green. So every run leaves ONE receipt line here
// naming every step's status, and the roll-call judges each step on its own:
// a step that has not been `ok` on N consecutive SCHEDULED ticks alarms
// (tools/box-rollcall.mjs § the keep outcome; N=3, Wright 2026-10-10).
//
// PROVENANCE (Wright 2026-10-13 08:24): postmark-office-keep.service is the
// scheduled unit by contract and writes source "scheduled";
// postmark-office-keep-by-hand.service runs the same script with source
// "by-hand", and a by-hand run neither extends nor clears a scheduled streak,
// so a manual success can never mask a scheduled failure. A line with NO source
// (older than this field) counts as scheduled; a line with a source this module
// does not know is "unknown" and never clears anything. Those are two rules.
//
// The reader here is this log's own: it judges the RAW text, so a line that is
// torn, oversize or not a keep-v1 receipt is a finding, never skipped. EVIDENCE
// IS NOT LAUNDERED (Rivet, first review): an unreadable line, or a receipt with
// a source this module does not know, written AFTER the last valid scheduled
// receipt stays an alarm until a later valid scheduled receipt recovers it. A
// by-hand run can neither hide it from the judge nor erase it on append: the
// writer keeps it (an unreadable line as a fixed marker naming only its
// category, never its bytes) outside the retention caps that a flood of hand
// runs fills.
