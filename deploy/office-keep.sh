# office-keep.sh — the office's keeping tick: the clones, the ledger, the
# settlements row, the world hydration and the panes. Split out of the old
# office tick (POS-268, 2026-09-27) so the rehydrate unit held only the two
# hydrates and could be retired on its own. It was (POS-268 part 5b,
# 2026-10-08): office.db is no longer built anywhere, and the world hydration,
# the one rehydrate step something still reads, runs here
# (deploy/office-world-hydrate.sh, § the world hydration below). Nothing here
# reads or writes office.db.
#
# Snapshot-under-lock / derive-outside, the same shape office-tick.sh had since
# 2026-07-30: the lock covers only the pulls, the mint pass and a
# `git clone --local` snapshot (seconds); the panes publish runs against the
# frozen snapshot, so the hold never grows with the town's history (pulse
# wright-2026-07-30-office-tick-lock-starves-write-paths).
#
# Runs on postmark-office-keep.timer at :07/:22/:37/:52 — the clock the whole
# tick ran on before the split, so the pulls, the mint, the settlements row and
# the panes are exactly as fresh as they were. The world hydration, which the
# rehydrate ran two minutes after this tick, now runs inside it, after the
# settlements row: the same order, from the same fetch.

# pen. That file carries four store passwords, the OWNER's among them, so this

# Most steps below are NON-FATAL by design: each prints a line and the tick goes
# on. That let a step fail on every tick forever while the unit read green. So
# every step records its status (ok / refused / skip / notrun, with a reason
# from deploy/keep-history.mjs's fixed vocabulary — never tool output) with
# `keep_step`, into a file in SNAP (an absolute path, so it survives the
# subshells and the mint pass's `cd`), and the EXIT trap writes ONE receipt line
# per run to $KEEP_LOG, then cleans SNAP as before. The roll-call judges each
# step's scheduled streak from that log (postmark-office-keep.timer's outcome).
# The receipt is the tick's bookkeeping, never its work: a receipt that cannot
# be written says so loudly and changes nothing about the tick's exit.
#
# Provenance (Wright 2026-10-13): this unit is the scheduled one by contract;
# postmark-office-keep-by-hand.service runs the same script with

# scheduled streak. Starting THIS unit by hand records "scheduled": an accepted
# limitation (deploy/DEPLOY.md § the keeping tick's receipt).

  # registry row, its grammar note and its `--welcome` header all say "the
  # office writes the bundle at a crossing", and until this line nothing did.
  # Measured on the train tip: 6 households admitted after the 09-14 by-hand
  # pass held no bundle and no scheduled thing would ever have paid them.
  #
  # ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is the town's refusals that fix it: `--welcome`
  # declines onto an unsettled tail ("run --append first") and declines a date
  # before the ledger's last. So it runs AFTER the mint pass and BEFORE verify,
  # inside this same flock, with the same key — its rows are verified and pushed
  # by the commit already below rather than sitting unsealed until the next tick.
  #
  # It mints only households the town's own `--welcome-plan` names, and the
  # town's once-per-household law refuses a second bundle on its own.
  #
  # ⚑ ITS EXIT IS SWALLOWED ON PURPOSE, and the first draft of this line got it
  # wrong. Chained with `&&`, one refused bundle would have stopped `stamp-verify`
  # and the commit below — stranding the `--append` rows that DID land, unsealed
  # and unpushed, until a later tick. A refusal means one household waits one
  # crossing; it must never hold the mint pass hostage. Bad rows are still caught:
  # anything this writes goes through the verify below it.
  #
  # ⚑ WHOLE OR NOTHING (POS-295, 2026-09-28). On 09-28 the verify failed on an
  # OLDER committed line (red since 13:59Z), the `&&` chain skipped the commit,
  # and nothing restored the file: Corey's appended welcome sat uncommitted in
  # the town clone from 18:37Z to 23:31Z, and every office write that pulls it
  # refused. Two rules now, both below:
  #   · CHECK BEFORE WRITING. A ledger that arrives red appends nothing, and the
  #     journal says the catch-up is off and why. A green arrival is the only
  #     state a new row is signed onto.
  #   · A FAILED CHECK AFTER WRITING PUTS THE CLONE BACK: the ledger's arrival
  #     bytes and no path the pass created, from an EXIT trap, so a tick killed
  #     mid-pass restores too (TERM/INT/HUP become exits so the trap runs; only
  #     SIGKILL escapes it). Discarding is safe because every row this pass
  #     writes is re-derivable: `--append` recomputes from the mail and the
  #     welcome plan re-reads the ledger, so the household waits one tick.
  # A pass that changed nothing skips the second verify: the arrival check
  # already read these exact bytes, so the quiet tick costs one verify, as before.
  # The trap disarms the moment the commit lands; a push that then fails leaves
  # a local commit, exactly as it did before this block.

# postmark-office-keep.timer row's outcome block: alarm_on_nonempty
# split_households / shared_keys, alarm_on_false checked). NON-FATAL: a split
# is the alarm's to raise, never this tick's to stop on. A run that produced no
# JSON (the tool absent or crashed) still writes a line, `checked: false`, so
# "did not run" never reads like "found nothing".
