# postmark-dev-freshen.sh — the dev channel stands back on the SANDBOX SEED.
#
# RE-AIMED 2026-08-26 (founder-ruled): the dev instance's default state is no
# longer origin/main but the declared snapshot — the sandbox/seed tag PAIR
# (first pair: S47's certified town 830a6996 / world 52c281b8). Advance the
# default by retagging sandbox/seed in both repos. Cadence dropped 10min ->
# nightly so a day's rehearsal is never yanked mid-act; on-demand forget is
# ./sandbox-reset.sh (which also rebuilds the derived DBs and restarts).
#
# The dev office commits acts into its LOCAL clones only (TOWN_PUSH=0; the push
# URL is DISABLED by design). Those local acts are rehearsal, not record. This
# script wipes them and stands both clones back on origin/main, under the dev
# office's own town lock so it never races a pen mid-write. Runs from
# postmark-dev-freshen.timer every 10 minutes.
#
# The world-clone ALSO refreshes draft/* remote-tracking refs (pruned), because
# the signed-in draft-overlay lens reads them — main-only fetching left dev's
# draft lens frozen at clone time (found 2026-08-22, the sketchbook-clean pass).
# Remote-tracking refs only; no local branches, no working-tree change.
#
# Repo copy of record: postmark-office deploy/postmark-dev-freshen.sh
#
# FAILS LOUD (2026-09-22, POS-192). The `set -euo pipefail` above never reached
# the work: everything below runs in the `bash -c` child that flock starts, and
# a child shell does not inherit -e. So when 1,918 root-owned files under
# world-clone and town-clone refused `git reset` (Permission denied), the loop
# carried on, the echo printed "stood back", and the unit exited 0 for as long
# as nobody looked. The child now sets its own `-euo pipefail`: the first failed
# git ends it with git's own exit code, flock returns that code, and exec makes
# it this script's — so the unit reads failed, the roll-call's freshen row sees
# Result=exit-code, and the success line prints only after every step succeeded.
# `switch ... || true` stays tolerated on purpose: the reset after it is the
# stand-back, and it is the step that must not fail silently.
#
# DEV SIGNS WITH ITS OWN KEY (POS-354, Darko 2026-10-07). The seed's ledger is
# prod's, signed with prod's key, and on 10-07 the dev root's stamp-key.pem was
# a byte-identical copy of prod's. So after the stand-back, the town clone is
# moved onto dev's own key (tools/dev-ledger-resign.mjs, from the dev office's
# carried tree): every signed line re-signed, seals unchanged, dev's public key
# installed, committed locally and never pushed. The commit is the same every
# night (fixed author and date, deterministic signatures), so the store's
# town-index head still finds it. It refuses a key whose public half is prod's:
# the seed's own tools/stamp-pubkey.pem, and prod's clone's public key passed as
# --not-key. Prod's PRIVATE key is never read (#453 review, F2). It re-signs only a
# clone whose push URL is disabled, under this root (F1).
# It runs last, so a refusal leaves the clones stood back and the unit failed.
#
# POSTMARK_DEV_ROOT, POSTMARK_DEV_FLOCK and the two key paths exist for
# test/box-rollcall.test.mjs only; the unit sets none, so the box runs the
# defaults below.
