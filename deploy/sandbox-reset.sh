# sandbox-reset.sh — reset the DEV office to the declared sandbox seed.
#
# THE DESIGN (founder-ruled 2026-08-26): the dev instance's default state is a
# certified settlement snapshot, declared as the `sandbox/seed` tag PAIR —
# postmark-town/postmark + postmark-town/postmark-world (first pair: S47's, town
# 830a6996 / world 52c281b8). Both clones hard-reset to their tag, derived
# state is deleted and rebuilt, the dev service restarts. Local rehearsal
# commits (TOWN_PUSH=0 keeps them local by construction) are DISCARDED —
# that is the point. To advance the default: retag sandbox/seed in both
# repos (founder's word) and run this again.
#
# oauth.db is deliberately KEPT: sign-ins are box-side state, not town state,
# and wiping it would lock every tester out after each reset.
