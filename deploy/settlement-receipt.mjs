// settlement-receipt.mjs — the crossing's receipt, composed rather than printf'd.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The receipt used to be six `printf` fields in settlement-auto.sh, and it said
// exactly one thing about what the crossing did: `"detail": "14 published"`.
// The sweep has SIX outcome channels — published, unpublished, left_drafted,
// withdrawn, quarantined, dropped — and three of them appeared on no surface at
// all. On 2026-08-26 a crossing left 42 marks drafted and reported nothing; a
// starving crossing printed "0 published, 0 unpublished" and read as a quiet day
// for two days.
//
// A receipt that can only be extended by editing a printf format string will be
// extended by nobody. This composes the receipt from the sweep's own report, so
// a channel the sweep learns to name appears here without anyone remembering to
// add it: `CHANNELS` is the enumeration, and a channel present in the sweep's
// report but missing from `CHANNELS` is reported as an unnamed channel rather
// than dropped silently.
//
// ── THE LAW IT ANSWERS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// LOGOS `the-town/the-crossing-speaks` is not a planted law; this file answers
// the founder's 2026-08-27 mandate directly instead: "RECEIPTS LIE BY OMISSION
// — the settlement commit says 'sweep N published, M unpublished' but
// left_drafted, dropped, quarantined never appear." The rule this encodes:
//
//   A CROSSING NAMES EVERY CHANNEL IT HAS A WORD FOR, INCLUDING THE EMPTY ONES,
//   AND A PASS THAT PUBLISHED NOTHING SAYS WHAT IT SURVEYED.
//
// The empty ones matter as much as the full ones: "0 quarantined" is a fact
// about this crossing, and its ABSENCE is indistinguishable from a crossing
// that never looked.
//
// Input is env, not argv, because settlement-auto.sh calls this from a `report`
// shell function where every value may legitimately be empty and quoting empty
// positional arguments in POSIX sh is how you get an off-by-one receipt.

import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

// WHICH MARK DIED AND IN WHOSE WORDS. The sweep writes the fold's own sentence
// into a quarantined row's `detail` and into a fold refusal's `cause`; this file
// carried neither, so S71 published a receipt that named Mari's household and
// not her mark, her cap, or her number. Pure and separate because a line
// composed in a script is watched by nothing — the lesson `escrowLines` paid for.
