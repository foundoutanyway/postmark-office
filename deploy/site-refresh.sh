#!/usr/bin/env bash
# site-refresh.sh — the town's data layer rebakes on the BOX, on the town's clock.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. postmark.town's mushy middle — every doorstep bundle, the mail
# pages, Ferry's Daily, the atlas mirrors — is rebaked today by two GitHub
# SCHEDULED workflows in postmark-site (.github/workflows/sync-atlas.yml extracts
# the town into main every */30; .github/workflows/deploy.yml rebuilds prod at the
# standing release tag every */30). GitHub's cron is best-effort and documents
# itself as such. On 2026-08-26 the delivery ran 97 minutes past a ferry crossing
# and 48 residents' doorstep pages served yesterday's mail while the ledger
# already carried today's.
#
# The freshness architecture (EPICS/POSTMARK/freshness-architecture.md, founder
# ruled 2026-08-26/27) moves the middle onto a box timer, verbatim:
#
#   "a 30-minute timer, phase-aligned ~:10 after the ferry crossings (the known
#    moments mail actually moves), lockfile single-flight, atomic
#    temp-build-then-symlink-swap (zero downtime; no stale-over-fresh ordering
#    race). GitHub Actions keeps only code releases."
#
# This file is that timer's hand. Its unit pair is postmark-site-refresh.service
# and .timer; the INSTALL block at the bottom of this header names every box-side
# step, assumption, and rollback.
#
# ── ONE RECIPE, TWO TRIGGERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This script REIMPLEMENTS NOTHING. Every step below invokes the site's own
# script, with the site's own arguments, in deploy.yml/sync-atlas.yml's own
# order, and the step comments name the workflow step each one mirrors. If the
# site changes how it builds itself, this file inherits the change; if it grows a
# step, this file has to grow the same line, and the mirrored step names are what
# make that drift greppable. The recipe is the site's; only the trigger is ours.
#
#   sync-atlas.yml                        this script
#   ──────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────
#   checkout postmark-site @ main         the extract tree ($ROOT/site @ main)
#   checkout postmark-town/postmark       $ROOT/town, pinned to origin/main's sha
#   npm install sharp                     ensure_deps, extract tree

#   commit + push to main                 NOT DONE — see "no commit" below
#
#   deploy.yml (release lane)             this script
#   ──────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────
#   checkout, pin to newest release/*     the build tree ($ROOT/build, detached)
#   overlay town data from main           rsync the extract tree's output in
#   take world-pin resolver from main     same three files, same `git checkout`
#   npm ci                                ensure_deps, build tree
#   resolve-world-pin.mjs                 same, plus the same install+verify
#   fetch-town.mjs                        already done in the extract tree
#   npm run build                         same
#   build-stamp.mjs --out dist-town/      same, plus BUILD_TOWN_SHA/BUILD_CROSSING
#   rsync --delete to the webroot         publish to a release dir + swap a link
#
# NO COMMIT. sync-atlas's output is committed to site main so that a later
# Actions run can find it; a box that builds and publishes in one pass has no
# such gap to bridge, so the extractor output stays ephemeral in the extract
# tree. That is the single biggest simplification here: no deploy key, no push
# race, no rebase-and-retry loop, and no half-hourly commit churn on main.
#
# ── THE TWO TREES, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE ────────────────────────────────────
#
# The site has two tenses and they are not negotiable: CODE comes from the newest
# release/* tag (a human approved it), DATA comes from main's extractors (they
# move at the town's pace). deploy.yml reconciles them with an overlay.
#
# The tempting simplification is one tree at the tag with main's tools/ checked
# in over it. It is wrong: src/lib/pm.mjs line 149 does
# `export { threadTitle } from "../../tools/lib/ids.mjs"` — the SITE CODE imports
# out of tools/, so `git checkout origin/main -- tools/` would silently change
# what the tag's pages compile against. Two trees keeps the seam where deploy.yml
# already put it: main's extractors produce data, the tag's code renders it, and
# the only files that cross are the three deploy.yml already names by hand.
#
# ── WHAT THE SNAPSHOT KEY COVERS, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST THE TOWN ───────────
#
# The quiet path is the whole point: on a tick where nothing moved this exits in
# seconds having done four fetches. But "nothing moved" cannot mean "the town did
# not move", because the box is now the ONLY thing that publishes prod content —
# so a newly cut release tag and a newly blessed settlement must wake it too, or
# they would sit unpublished until the town happened to change. The key is:
#
#   town origin/main · site origin/main · newest release/* tag · settlement tags
#
# Site main is in the key for the transition: while sync-atlas.yml is still
# enabled it commits every 30 minutes, so main moves every tick and the quiet
# path will rarely fire. That is correct — it means this timer keeps pace with
# the workflow it replaces — and it goes quiet on its own the moment sync-atlas
# is retired (INSTALL step 7).
#
# ── FAILURE POSTURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A failed build publishes NOTHING. The symlink still points at the last good
# release, so the floor keeps serving (freshness-architecture: "the floor may lag,
# but it must never lie about being current" — and the page's own generated-at
# disclosure is what keeps the lag honest). Exit 1 loudly; systemd records it;
# site-sentinel's crossing probe is what turns a run of failures into a Discord
# message. This script alarms nobody itself, by the same rule harbor-watch and
# site-sentinel follow: detection is mechanical, repair stays a hand.
#
# ── BOX FACTS THIS IS DESIGNED AROUND ───────────────────────────────────────
#
#  * /tmp on this box refuses hardlinks: a `git clone --local` there dies with
#    "failed to create link ... Operation not permitted" (diagnosed 2026-08-26).
#    So: no --local clones anywhere here, and TMPDIR is forced under $ROOT so
#    that node's mkdtempSync (resolve-world-pin.mjs clones the world repo into
#    one) never lands in /tmp either.
#  * nginx serves prod straight off /var/www/postmark-town-site
#    (deploy/nginx-postmark-town.conf line 68, and deploy.yml's rsync target).
#    INSTALL converts that path from a directory into a SYMLINK; nginx follows
#    symlinks by default and its config does not change, which keeps the
#    box-config drift surface at zero.
#
# Env (unit): SITE_REFRESH_ROOT, SITE_WEBROOT, SITE_REMOTE, TOWN_REMOTE,
#             WORLD_REMOTE, POSTMARK_API, SITE_REFRESH_REPORT,
#             SITE_REFRESH_KEEP, SITE_REFRESH_MAX_PASSES, GH_TOKEN (optional).
# Cwd: irrelevant — every path is absolute.
# Exit: 0 published / quiet / stood down behind the lock · 1 the build failed.
#
# ── INSTALL (Wright's hand; this script never touches the box itself) ────────
#
# Read the live copies before installing over them (the box-config drift law:
# the box's file is the truth, the repo's is the intent).
#
#   # 0. THE OFFICE GOES FIRST. This branch also teaches GET /api/ to serve the
#   #    town's crossing number, and both the page's disclosure and
#   #    site-sentinel's crossing probe read it from there. Until the office
#   #    carrying that change is deployed, every crossing is honestly null: the
#   #    doorstep omits the claim, /build.json stamps null, and the sentinel says
#   #    UNKNOWN rather than green. Nothing breaks — the feature is simply
#   #    absent — but there is no reason to install the timer and then wonder.
#   #    The falsifiable check, which only the new code can pass. Run against
#   #    both sides before trusting it: it prints a number on the new office and
#   #    says ABSENT on the standing one, which is what makes it a probe rather
#   #    than a formality (verified both ways 2026-08-27 — 152 on the branch,
#   #    ABSENT on prod). The manifest is pretty-printed, so a line-wise grep for
#   #    "crossing" is NOT a substitute; it comes back empty either way.
#   curl -sS https://postmark.town/api/ | node -e \
#     'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>console.log(JSON.parse(s).crossing?.number ?? "ABSENT — the office has not shipped it yet"))'
#
#   # 1. the service's own root, owned by the office user
#   sudo mkdir -p /srv/postmark-site-refresh /srv/postmark-harbor
#   sudo chown meepo /srv/postmark-site-refresh /srv/postmark-harbor
#
#   # 2. the script itself, AND its helper beside it: the script runs
#   #    "$SELF_DIR/site-refresh-pin.mjs" (POS-601) from its own directory, and
#   #    without it every publish stops at "the world pin could not be written"
#   #    (the standing release keeps serving). The office deploy carries both.
#   sudo install -o meepo -m 755 deploy/site-refresh.sh /srv/postmark-office/deploy/site-refresh.sh
#   sudo install -o meepo -m 644 deploy/site-refresh-pin.mjs /srv/postmark-office/deploy/site-refresh-pin.mjs
#
#   # 3. meepo must be able to swap the link in /var/www (it owns nothing there today)
#   sudo chown meepo /var/www           # or: setfacl -m u:meepo:rwx /var/www
#
#   # 3b. the falsifiers, against a throwaway sandbox — they touch nothing real
#   #     and take about a minute. They are how the three bugs in this script's
#   #     first draft were found; run them before trusting a new copy of it.
#   bash /srv/postmark-office/deploy/site-refresh-selftest.sh
#
#   # 4. FIRST RUN BY HAND, publishing nowhere — proves the build works before
#   #    anything the public reads is touched. This writes a release dir and a
#   #    report and swaps a link inside the sandbox root, not the real webroot.
#   #
#   #    EXPECT THIS ONE TO BE SLOW: it clones the town (large — images) and the
#   #    site, runs two npm ci's, and builds every page. Ten to twenty minutes is
#   #    normal for the FIRST run and says nothing about the steady state, which
#   #    is a few fetches on a quiet tick. Watch it rather than backgrounding it.
#   sudo -u meepo env SITE_WEBROOT=/srv/postmark-site-refresh/sandbox-webroot \
#     /srv/postmark-office/deploy/site-refresh.sh
#   ls -l /srv/postmark-site-refresh/sandbox-webroot   # -> a symlink into releases/
#   cat /srv/postmark-harbor/site-refresh.json
#   # sanity: the built bytes carry the freshness stamp
#   cat "$(readlink -f /srv/postmark-site-refresh/sandbox-webroot)/build.json"
#
#   # 5. THE CUTOVER — directory becomes symlink. Keep the old bytes as the
#   #    rollback; do it in one rename so no request ever sees a missing root.
#   REL="$(readlink -f /srv/postmark-site-refresh/sandbox-webroot)"
#   sudo mv /var/www/postmark-town-site /var/www/postmark-town-site.pre-box
#   sudo -u meepo ln -sfn "$REL" /var/www/.postmark-town-site.next
#   sudo -u meepo mv -Tf /var/www/.postmark-town-site.next /var/www/postmark-town-site
#   curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://postmark.town/
#   curl -sS https://postmark.town/build.json
#
#   # 6. the timer
#   sudo cp deploy/postmark-site-refresh.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#   sudo systemctl enable --now postmark-site-refresh.timer
#   systemctl list-timers postmark-site-refresh --no-pager     # expect :10 and :40
#
#   #    EXPECT THE FIRST TIMER TICK TO SAY "quiet", AND THAT IS CORRECT: step 4
#   #    already built this exact snapshot and wrote it into state.json, and step
#   #    5 pointed prod at it. The first tick that does real work is the one
#   #    after the town next moves — within thirty minutes, or at the next ferry.
#   #    If you would rather watch a real build now, `sudo -u meepo systemctl
#   #    start postmark-site-refresh` after any town commit lands.
#
#   # 7. ONLY AFTER a full ferry crossing has landed on the box timer and the
#   #    site's own crossing disclosure agrees with the office: retire GitHub's
#   #    two content schedules, so one writer owns prod content.
#   #      postmark-site .github/workflows/sync-atlas.yml   — drop `schedule:`
#   #      postmark-site .github/workflows/deploy.yml       — drop `schedule:`
#   #    Both keep workflow_dispatch and their push/tag triggers: code releases
#   #    stay on Actions, which is exactly what the architecture memo says. Doing
#   #    this BEFORE step 5 verifies would leave the site with no refresh at all.
#
#   # ROLLBACK, at any point, in one rename — the old directory is still there:
#   sudo systemctl disable --now postmark-site-refresh.timer
#   sudo rm -f /var/www/postmark-town-site        # removes the SYMLINK, not the bytes
#   sudo mv /var/www/postmark-town-site.pre-box /var/www/postmark-town-site
#   # then re-enable the two `schedule:` blocks if step 7 had been taken.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS, stated so they can be checked rather than hoped:
#   * user `meepo` may write /var/www (step 3) — it does not today.
#   * node >= 22.12 on PATH for meepo (the site's engines field).
#   * `rsync` and `flock` exist on the box (rsync is deploy.yml's own transport;
#     flock ships in util-linux).
#   * disk: a second full town clone plus two site trees plus KEEP release dirs.
#     The town clone is the big one (images). Budget ~2-3 GB and watch it once.
#   * the box can reach github.com over https unauthenticated (both repos are
#     public). GH_TOKEN is optional and only raises extract-town's PR-state
#     budget; without it those fields go null, exactly as they do in Actions.
#
# Repo copy of record: postmark-office deploy/site-refresh.sh

# -E (errtrace) is load-bearing, not decoration: without it bash does NOT inherit
# the ERR trap into shell functions, so a failure inside build_once() would exit
# with git's own status and write no board at all. The selftest caught it —
# ten reported failures against a report file three runs stale.
