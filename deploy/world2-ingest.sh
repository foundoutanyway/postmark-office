# world2-ingest.sh — the two projection pens on a poll.
#
#   law-ingest    world-law repo -> law_projection + identities
#   stamp-ingest  town repo      -> stamp_projection
#
# ── WHY A POLL AT ALL, AND WHAT A DEAD ONE COSTS ────────────────────────────
# world2/tools/README.md is explicit that on-merge is the shape and the poll is
# the fallback, and equally explicit about the blast radius, verbatim:
#
#   "A dead webhook degrades only the door's advisory sufficiency read — never
#    a clearing."
#
# That sentence is what makes 15 minutes an acceptable number rather than a
# guess. The doors read these projections to tell a resident whether they have
# the stamps for a stake BEFORE they commit to one; fifteen minutes of
# staleness there is a slightly-behind answer to an advisory question. The
# authoritative read happens at the candle, where the clearing does the town
# ingest itself and REFUSES on a null law pin. Nothing this timer can do wrong
# reaches an outcome.
#
# ── ONE UNIT, TWO PENS — AND WHY THAT STOPPED BEING TRUE (2026-09-19) ───────
# This file used to argue that the two pens belong on one unit: shared cadence,
# shared blast radius, and splitting them would be "structure bought before the
# pain (keep-simple)". The pain arrived, and it was not the one that paragraph
# was watching for.
#
# On 2026-08-31 the founder parked `postmark-world2-ingest.timer` — for a reason
# about the world's OUTCOMES (acts, claims, marks): a re-lift from git "would
# launder v1's record into v2's and destroy the writer comparison the shadow era
# exists to make". Neither pen here writes an outcome. They copy the rulebook and
# the ledger, repo-first inputs the store may not author. But the park took the
# whole unit, and `law-ingest` is the ONLY writer of `law_projection` anywhere in
# the office, so the law copy simply stopped: `a23a8d17` (2026-09-05) until one
# hand-run on 2026-09-17 set it to `1688a5af`, then frozen again — 37 commits
# behind world main by 2026-09-19 (postmark#2893).
#
# The designed alarm could not fire either. The paragraph below still says a dead
# law pen "shows up as the clearing refusing" on a NULL pin — true, and the final
# pass of 09-05 wrote a VALID pin. A frozen non-null pin is never null, so the
# guard that was supposed to be the louder alarm never made a sound. That is the
# real cost of one unit: the town could not park one pen without parking both,
# and the one it did not mean to park was the one with no second watcher.
#
# RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-19): "split for now is good." The law pen gets its own
# unit and its own clock — `postmark-world2-law-ingest.{service,timer}`, `law`
# mode, the same :04/:19/:34/:49 marks. The parked unit and its files are
# UNTOUCHED, and `stamp-ingest` stays parked with it.
#
# There is still only ONE copy of each pen, and this is still the only script
# that runs them. The mode argument is the whole of the split.
#
# The law pen is the one with teeth, and not because of this timer: a null
# world-law pin is the guard that STOPS a clearing. That guard is real and it is
# not a freshness check — see above for the case it cannot see.

# ── MODE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# No argument is today's behaviour, byte-for-byte: both pens, `ingest.json`.
#
# EACH MODE WRITES ITS OWN STATE FILE, and that is not tidiness. A heartbeat is
# an instrument, and it has to be able to say which thing it measured: if the
# law unit and the (parked, one day maybe resumed) both-pens unit wrote one
# path, the law row's heartbeat would go green on a run that was not its own,
# two units would race on the same `mv -f`, and every law tick would overwrite
# the parked rail's last receipt — the 2026-09-17 hand-run evidence that its
# stamp pen exited 0. A pen that did not run gets NO LINE in the state, rather
# than a zero-exit line that reads like a receipt.
#
# Nothing in this repo reads any of these files today (`grep -rn ingest.json`:
# this script and one DEPLOY.md sentence). The law file's first reader is the
# roll-call row this change adds.
