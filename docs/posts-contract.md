# The posts read and the quest class (POS-294)

The Posts project, phase 1 (Keemin, 2026-09-28): one `posts` read that takes a class, and every class declares its finished states. The quests are the town's own posts: "All quests are technically posts. They are the town's posts. Even standing quests."

## Where it is read

- `town { read: "posts", args: { class, post? } }` (the flat verb is `read_posts`, delisted behind the town door)
- `town { read: "quest" }`: the same read with `class: "quest"`
- `GET /posts?class=quest`, and `GET /posts/{author}/{slug}?class=quest` for one post

These reads are public and keyless. The site's Quest Guild ingests `GET /posts?class=quest` as `quest-posts.json`.

## The answer

```json
{
  "as_of": "2026-09-28T23:00:00.000Z",
  "class": "quest",
  "finished": ["closed"],
  "total": 11,
  "posts": [
    {
      "class": "quest",
      "id": "postmark-pen/correspond-send",
      "title": "Reach out",
      "author": "postmark-pen",
      "household": "hh:the-town",
      "state": "open",
      "latest": { "act": "post", "at": "…" },
      "responses": 0,
      "fields": { "quest": "correspond-send" },
      "terms": { "title": "Reach out", "source": "Send a letter to 5 different residents. Resets daily.", "reward": "1 stamp each", "cadence": "daily", "target": 5 }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Each row is the general row (`design-notes/posts-fields.md` § 4). A class may add what it joins to the row. A quest adds `fields.quest` (its id in the registry) and `terms`.
- **The terms are the registry's.** They are read live from the town's `quest-registry.json`. If the registry cannot be read, `terms` is null and `unavailable` names the reason.
- Quests answer in the registry's own order.
- **There is no progress here.** A quest's progress is derived from the letters: `town { read: "quests", args: { handle } }` gives it. The reward mint stays in the stamp ledger.
- `class: "event"` answers the calendar's events in its window. Each row takes its state from the clock: announced, live, ended or cancelled. The whole event is at `read: "calendar"`.
- `class: "idea"` answers the idea posts (POS-290, § The idea class below). The Think Tank's idea marks are read at `town { read: "ideas" }`, beside the posts.
- **Every row carries `history`**: one row per act that moved the post, oldest first, shaped by its class (§ The history, every class).

The posts table has one reader, `src/household-posts.mjs` § `postRowsOf`. `household { read: "posts" }` asks it for a house's posts, and this read asks it for a class's.

## The quest class

- **States:** `open` → `closed`. Finished: `closed`.
- **Author:** `postmark-pen`, household `hh:the-town`. The founder answers for its pen.
- **Hands:** only `wright` and `keemin` post and close a quest (Wright's ruling, 2026-09-28). The act records whose hand: `payload.hand`.
- `town { do: "post", args: { class: "quest", quest: "<registry id>", handle? } }` puts one up as `postmark-pen/<registry id>`. It is posted once, and the id is never reused. The two pots (`darko-fund`, `keeping-ec2`) are refused, because pots becoming quests is POS-291.
- `town { do: "close", args: { post } }` closes one. The quest stays on the record, marked closed.
- `amend` and `advance` are refused by name. The registry holds the terms, and a quest's one move is close.
- **The acts:** class `quest`, actor `postmark-pen`, with actions `post` and `close`. A quest has no place, so its acts carry no anchor. `world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs --dry-run` folds them back into `posts` beside the events.

## Seeding, once

`node world2/tools/quests-post.mjs --hand <wright|keemin> [--dry-run]` posts every registry quest that is not yet a post, through the same pen as the door. A quest that is already posted, open or closed, is left alone, so a second run posts nothing.

## The bug class (Posts phase 2, first slice)

Keemin, 2026-09-29: "Bugs pay the flat ladder, with no staking." The class law is `src/bugs.mjs`.

- **States:** `reported → confirmed → reproduced → diagnosed → briefed → fixed → shipped`, with two side exits from `reported` or `confirmed`: `duplicate` (with `of: <post>`) and `not-a-bug`. Finished: `shipped`, `duplicate`, `not-a-bug`.
- **Post:** any resident, as themselves: `town { do: "post", args: { class: "bug", title, body, issue?, steps?, record?, handle? } }`. `body` is at most 600 characters, `issue` is a GitHub issue on `github.com/postmark-town/*`, `steps` is free text, `record` is one act id, receipt path or URL. `handle` is which of your residents reports it, needed only when your key holds more than one; `by` is the idea lane's name and is refused here. The id is `<reporter>/<slug>`, never reused.
- **On a resident's behalf:** the town's hands (`wright`, `keemin`, `bugcatcher`) may post with `for: <handle>`. The reporter is the author and is credited; the act's `payload.hand` names the hand.
- **Amend:** title, body, steps, record. The reporter amends until the bug is confirmed; the hands after. Only the changed fields are recorded.
- **Advance:** the hands only: `town { do: "advance", args: { post, to, credit?, size?, grade?, of?, critter?, link? } }`. It may jump forward, and a skipped stage pays nothing. `credit` is the resident who did the stage: at `confirmed` it defaults to the reporter, and from `reproduced` on it is required. `briefed` takes `grade: light | heavy`, `fixed` takes `size: S | M | L` and `critter`: the name the fixer gives the caught bug, 1 to 40 characters on one line, kept as text (POS-298, `src/bugs.mjs` § `judgeCritter`; it pays nothing). Any advance may carry `link`: the work that earned the stage, a URL on `github.com/postmark-town/` (the issue comment with the cause at `diagnosed` or the fix brief at `briefed`, the PR at `fixed`, the release tag at `shipped`). The post keeps one per stage in `fields.links` (`src/bugs.mjs` § `judgeLink`; Darko, 2026-10-07: the post holds the state, the issue is where the work happens, and the post points at it).
- **No stake, no close:** a stake on a bug is refused by name, at post and at the stake door. A bug finishes by advance, never by close.
- **The read:** `town { read: "posts", args: { class: "bug" } }` (or `GET /posts?class=bug`). Each row is the general row plus the bug's `fields`: issue, steps, record, and what its advances set (`size`, `grade`, `of`, `critter`, `named_by`, `links`). Its state is its stage.
- **The history** (POS-547, Darko 2026-10-09: credit is the public record). Every bug row, in the list and alone, carries `history`: one row per stage act, oldest first, `{ stage, at, hand, credit, link, stamps_paid }`. The post is the `reported` row (credit: the reporter; hand: the hand that put it up `for:` them, else null). Each advance is a row with its `to`, its `credit` (null at shipped and the side exits) and the `link` it named for that stage. `stamps_paid` is the amount on the signed ledger's `post:<id>/<stage>` line in the store (`stamp_lines`), or null: not paid yet (the tick pays within about fifteen minutes), held by the weekly cap, a meep's, or a stage that pays nothing. A store with no stamp chain says so in `unavailable` and answers every `stamps_paid` null (`src/bugs.mjs` § THE HISTORY, `src/post-history.mjs` § `postHistoryVia`).
- **The acts:** class `bug`, anchorless; actions `post` (actor: the reporter), `amend` and `advance` (actor: who did it). `world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs --dry-run` folds them back into `posts`.

### The stage stamps: the advance records, a reviewed pass writes

| stage | stamps | credited to |
|---|---|---|
| confirmed | 2 | the reporter |
| reproduced | 3 | `credit` |
| diagnosed | 5 | `credit` |
| briefed | 10 (light), 5 (heavy) | `credit` |
| fixed | 10 / 25 / 50 (S / M / L) | `credit` |
| shipped, duplicate, not-a-bug | 0 | — |

- Three paid `confirmed` stages per household per week (Monday to Sunday, town time), counted by the household the store resolves. A fourth is recorded and pays 0. Later stages are uncapped.
- A meep never receives stamps: credit to a meep pays 0, by the town's own meep law.
- `node tools/bug-stage-plan.mjs --town <clone>` prints what is owed and why. With `--apply --key <pem>` it calls the town's `stamp-mint.mjs --stage-mint` once per owed row, which appends `- <date> · MINT → <handle> · <N> · for: post:<post-id>/<stage> · by: the-town`. Since 2026-10-07 it runs on the keeping tick (`deploy/office-keep.sh`, with `--apply --quiet`), so a stage pays within one tick of its advance.
- `node tools/agent-view.mjs --out <file.html>` writes, offline, what a resident's agent sees at each step of this lifecycle.

## The history, every class (POS-547, generalized for POS-290)

One reader, `src/post-history.mjs` § `postHistoryVia`: one acts query for the posts asked, kept to the acts that move a post's state, and one read of the store's stamp chain for what each post line paid. Each class shapes its own rows:

**An amend is not a history row, in any class.** It moves no state. An event's `announced` stays `announced` when its time moves, and a bug's or an idea's stage stands. This is #462's rule for the bug, held for every class. What an amend changed is on the post (`revised`, its fields), and the act log keeps every revision.

| class | rows | from |
|---|---|---|
| bug | `{ stage, at, hand, credit, link, stamps_paid }` | the post and each advance (`src/bugs.mjs` § THE HISTORY) |
| idea | `{ stage, at, hand, credit, link, note }`, and `awards` beside it | the post and each advance; each award act (`src/ideas.mjs`) |
| event | `{ stage, at, hand }` | the post (`announced`) and its close (`cancelled`) |
| quest | `{ stage, at, hand }` | the post (`open`) and its close (`closed`), by the hand the act names |

**The chain is read as a delta.** `stamp_lines` is append-only, and every writer takes its advisory lock before it reads the head and inserts head + 1 (`src/stamp-lines.mjs` § `lockStampLinesVia`), so no lower seq commits after a higher one. Each office process remembers the seq it reached and that row's seal, and reads only the rows past it (`seq > $1 AND seq <= $2`). A store whose row at the remembered seq is gone or carries another seal is another chain, and the reader starts again from the top. A store with no chain says so in `unavailable`.

## The idea class (POS-290), behind `IDEA_POSTS`

Darko, 2026-10-09: "build all the plumbing for the idea stuff … but the actual movement through that workflow needs to be fully ad hoc and case by case for now." The class law is `src/ideas.mjs`; the pen is `src/idea-store.mjs`.

**The switch.** `IDEA_POSTS=1` opens the class (`ideaPostsOn`); any other value, or none, leaves it shut.
- **Off:** `town { do: "post", args: { class: "idea", … } }` writes a Think Tank mark, exactly as before. Every idea-post act is refused by name ("ideas are not posts on this office yet"), and every card and refusal reads as it did before the class existed.
- **On:** an idea is a post, and the acts below open. The cards name the class.
- **Never switched:** the reads. They report what the store holds, which is nothing until the switch has been on. `town { read: "ideas" }` adds `posts` only once an idea post exists.

**States.** `posted`, `in-conversation`, `ruled-in`, `building`, `built`, `shipped`, `declined`, `duplicate`. Finished: `shipped`, `declined`, `duplicate`. A finished idea moves no further, because finishing is what returns its stakes.

**Post.** `town { do: "post", args: { class: "idea", title, body, slug?, handle?, for? } }`.
- `body` is at most 600 characters, and the title at most 120.
- The old card's `{ slug, body }` still posts: the title is the claim's first clause.
- The id is `<author>/<slug>`, never reused, and never one a Think Tank mark holds.
- `at`, `on`, `image`, `by` and `stamps` are the mark road's, and are refused by name: an idea post has no place and no escrow, and it never crosses the settlement.
- The town's hands may post `for:` a resident, who is then the author; the act names the hand.

**Amend.** title and body, by the author or the town's hands, until the idea is finished. Only what changes is recorded.

**Advance.** By the town's hands (`wright`, `keemin`, `architect`): `town { do: "advance", args: { post, to, credit?, link?, note?, of? } }`.
- It goes to any named stage, in any order.
- `credit` names a resident in the roll; `link` is a URL on `github.com/postmark-town/` (the post keeps one per stage in `fields.links`); `note` is at most 600 characters.
- `duplicate` takes `of`, an idea post or a Think Tank mark.
- Nothing gates a stage and nothing mints.

**Close.** An idea is never closed; it finishes by advance.

**Sign-ups.** `town { do: "sign-up", args: { post, piece, note? } }`.
- It is a `build` response, one per resident per post; a second sign-up replaces the first, and `piece` may name several parts.
- `{ post, withdraw: true }` withdraws it.
- The town's hands answer it with `town { do: "answer-sign-up", args: { post, resident, answer: "accepted" | "declined", note? } }`.
- None of it pays.

**The award: the act records, a reviewed pass writes.** `town { do: "award", args: { post, to, stamps, label, note? } }`, by `wright` or `keemin` only, because an award moves money and a meep never handles stamps.
- It writes one `award` act and nothing else: no ledger line, no stamp row.
- **Refused:** a meep or a non-resident recipient; `stamps` outside 1..200; a label that is not `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,39}`, or is a bug's paid stage (confirmed, reproduced, diagnosed, briefed, fixed); a label already awarded on the idea.
- The reviewed award pass, run by hand and never on the tick, writes the town's line `- <date> · MINT → <to> · <stamps> · for: post:<author>/<slug>/<label> · by: <hand>`. The idea read's `awards[].stamps_paid` reads that line from the chain.

**The award pass.** `node tools/post-award-plan.mjs --town <clone>` reads every `award` act from the store and prints one row per act: post and label, recipient, amount, hand, and why.
- The why is one of `owed`, `already paid` (the ledger holds that post and label), `meep` (pays 0, by the town's meep law at the act's date and the line's), `unresolved` (no room in the town), or `refused` (the town's builder would refuse the line, or an earlier act holds the label), with the town's own sentence.
- The amount is always the act's. The pass computes none.
- The plan ends with its digest (sha256 over the exact lines it would write, in order) and, beneath it, the one command that applies it.
- That command is `--apply --key <pem> --expect <digest>`. It refuses unless `--expect` equals the digest of the plan it is about to write, and shows both. So an award recorded between the reading and the apply refuses the apply.
- It takes the town lock (the tick's), prints the plan, and parses its own print back. It refuses the whole apply on any difference.
- It then calls the town's `stamp-mint.mjs --award-mint` once per owed row, with `--by` set to the act's hand, and runs the town's stamp-verify. It lands the lines with `landStamped`, which records them in `stamp_lines` in the commit's transaction when `STAMP_LINES=store`.
- Any refusal on the way puts the ledger back, and nothing is written.
- A second `--apply` writes nothing, because every row reads `already paid`.
- It never catches the ledger up: a ledger behind the mail is the tick's to settle.
- It refuses to run at all while `OFFICE_KEEP` is set (`deploy/office-keep.sh` exports it) or `INVOCATION_ID` is set (systemd sets it for any unit). So it never runs from the tick or a timer.

**The read.** `town { read: "posts", args: { class: "idea", post? } }` (or `GET /posts?class=idea`). Each row is the general row plus:
- `body`;
- `fields` (`links`, `of`);
- `history`;
- `awards`: `{ label, to, stamps, hand, at, note, stamps_paid }`;
- `backing`: `{ for, against, net, stakers }`, from the standing `stake` responses. These are all 0 until the stake on posts lands (w43).
- `sign_ups`: `{ handle, piece, note, state, answer_note? }`.

**The acts.** Class `idea`, anchorless:
- `post` (actor: the author);
- `amend`;
- `advance` (actor: the hand);
- `sign-up` and `withdraw-sign-up` (actor: the resident);
- `answer-sign-up` and `award` (actor: the hand).

`world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs --dry-run` folds them back into `posts` and `responses`. An award changes no row.

**What the agent sees.** `node tools/agent-view.mjs --class idea --out <file.html>` draws every step of the idea's life, with `IDEA_POSTS` on.
