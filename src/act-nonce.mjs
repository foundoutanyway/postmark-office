// act-nonce.mjs — A WORLD ACT'S RETRY KEY (POS-246, w41)
//
// "A retried world act writes once." The paper grammar POS-70 §5 ruled for the
// send and the five paper acts (town-updates.mjs § paperDoor) — the in-flight
// map, the lookup before the act, the first act's receipt read back off its
// row, the disclosure when the key cannot be kept — applied to the acts the
// world door dispatches. The say is NOT here: it keeps its own key for one
// conversation lull (voices.mjs § THE RETRY KEY, migration 027), and the door
// hands it through untouched.
//
// ── WHERE THE KEY IS KEPT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On the act, in 027's `acts.nonce` column, never in the payload (the payload
// leaves the box in the notary's archive; a retry key is not a fact about the
// act). `acts` is append-only (002), so the key cannot be stamped after the
// write: it rides the INSERT. The door does not thread it through the eleven
// handlers and their twenty append sites; it opens a scope around the handler,
// and `world2-pen.mjs § actsInsert` asks `nonceForActRow` for it. The FIRST act
// row the call writes carries it, and only that one: an act that writes a
// second row (a walk set down by its ground, a stake beside a mark) is one act,
// and one key.
//
// The kept spelling is `<door action>:<nonce>`, so the same word spent on a
// walk and then on a stake is two acts — the paper door narrows its lookup to
// the one act for the same reason ("handing the home's receipt back for the
// window would be the wrong receipt"). The lookup is scoped to the caller's
// own residents, so a nonce cannot be probed across households.
//
// ── WHAT THE ANSWER CAN AND CANNOT SAY ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A repeat answers the FIRST act's receipt read back off its row — id, instant,
// crossing, actor, action, object — never a replay of the live answer, which a
// walk or a ride composes from the world as it stood and which no row holds.
// An act that wrote no row (an unstaked mark is a private draft, and a private
// draft never reaches `acts`: world-journal.mjs § THE DEFERRAL) has nowhere to
// keep its key; it lands, and says so (`nonce_honoured: false`), exactly as a
// paper act says so on an office with no town log.
//
// Migration 052 is the guard between two offices (or two calls that race past
// the lookup): a unique index refuses the second row, and that refusal answers
// as the first act's receipt rather than as a refused pen.
