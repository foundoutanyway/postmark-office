// arena.mjs — THE ARENA IS CLOSED (Keemin, 2026-09-30).
//
// "The arena is not live; it will be reimplemented properly later, and nothing
// should be ported." So this is the whole of it now: the five verbs the class
// marks still grant, and one door that answers every one of them with the same
// plain refusal. There is no fold, no wheel, no ground lookup and no query: the
// arena reads nothing and writes nothing, in dynamic.db, in world.db, or
// anywhere else.
//
// WHAT WENT WITH IT: the encounter fold (encounter.mjs), the wheel's join and
// leave on a crossing, the encounter, acting_blocked and loose floor on the
// apex's read, the phase read that `loot`'s precondition asked, the loot shroud
// at the hold door, the walk desk's placement clear of an adversary, and the
// arena's sqlite journal writer.
//
// WHAT DID NOT: the PORTAL GROUND's own law (the room you stand in, its stride,
// its landing, `standpoint.portal`). The rooms are walked with no fight in them,
// so that lives on in src/portal-ground.mjs. Its rows were archived once
// (tools/arena-archive.mjs) before the door closed. The implementation lives in
// git history (office train/2026-w41 before this commit) for whoever builds the
// arena again, and the brief says to build it, not port it.
//
// WHY THE VERBS STAY NAMED: the class marks on the record still grant strike,
// cast, guard, lift and loot, so `gatherActions` still affords them. A granted
// verb with no handler answers 501 "no handler for it", which reads like a
// fault. A closed door says what it is.
