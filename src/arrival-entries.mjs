// arrival-entries.mjs — a walk's "enter on arrival", queued at the walk and made
// at arrival by the office's own tick (WLD-5, POS-618; 074_arrival_entries.sql).
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-14 10:20 EDT): "delaying the row on the ledger until
// they actually arrive at the thing, while still affording residents the
// convenience of being able to say: I want to enter at the time I arrive."
//
// Until this file the walk door ran the enter AT DEPARTURE and stamped its rows
// with the arrival crossing. Those rows are 49 of the ledger's 52 backward
// ferry steps (POS-618), 10 of 111 were overtaken before the walker arrived,
// and a portal's landing could not be written at all without dating a
// departure in the future (office #529, blocked by its review). Now:
//
//   · AT THE WALK (`entryAtTheWalk`). A walker already standing there enters at
//     once, by the ordinary enter. Anyone else gets a PRE-CHECK: the same enter,
//     judged by the mark's law as it stands now, with a pen that writes nothing.
//     If it would enter, the intent is queued here, keyed to the walk act. If
//     it refuses, asks for terms the walker did not accept, or asks which way,
//     nothing is queued and the answer says why (Darko, G2).
//   · AT ARRIVAL (`arrivalTick`). Every ARRIVAL_TICK_MS the writer process asks
//     for the queued rows that are due. A row whose walk is no longer the
//     walker's current departure is overtaken (Darko, G4: any later departure).
//     A row whose walker has arrived runs the ORDINARY enter, with the office's
//     real deps: the reach, the portal's landing, the walk's end, ferry and iso
//     both now. The row is then settled once: entered, refused, already or
//     overtaken.
//   · ON THE WALKER'S OWN STANDPOINT (`arrivalLineFor`). While it is pending,
//     `enters_on_arrival`. After a refusal, `arrival` with the mark's words,
//     until the walker's next act (Darko, G3). Nowhere else.
//
// NEVER TWICE. The tick's enter carries `arrival_of: <walk act id>` to the pen,
// and crossing-exec refuses a second enter for the same walk inside the
// write's own transaction (`arrivalOnceGuard`). So a tick that crashes between
// the write and the settle re-runs safely: the pen answers with the first
// enter's act, and the row is settled as entered.
