// arrival-heard.mjs — "where did you hear about Postmark?" (POS-292).
//
// Asked on the join (Keemin, 2026-09-28, from Little Bird in Core Team). The
// list was ruled the same night; one choice plus an optional note, and it is
// SKIPPABLE: nothing here can refuse a join.
//
// ── PRIVATE TO THE OPERATORS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The answer is about the HUMAN, so it lives in its own store table
// (030_arrival_heard.sql) that no pen can read: `office_api` may INSERT and
// nothing else. The one read is `arrival_heard_weekly()`, which answers
// counts per ISO week and suppresses every cell under 3 into one "fewer than
// 3" count per week (Wright's ruling C, 2026-09-28): a keyless GET is a public
// egress, so the protection lives at the source. The note never leaves the
// store; an operator reads it at psql as the owner.
//
// ── THE WRITE, ON BOTH ROADS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `declare`: `src/declare-exec.mjs` calls `recordHeard` right after
// `joinHousehold`, under the town lock, best-effort: a failure is logged once
// and the join stands.
//
// `begin`, the berth's bridge, asks the same two fields (POS-570) but joins
// nobody: it parks its declaration on the berth row until the human's co-sign
// click runs it. THE ANSWER NEVER RIDES THAT ROW: `oauth_berths` is readable
// by the office's own pen, mirrored into oauth.db, and never deleted. So
// `parkHeard` hands it to the store's `berth_heard_park()` (073), which keeps
// it where no pen can read it, and the co-sign's declare-exec calls
// `recordHeard` with the berth's slug: `berth_heard_land()` moves the answer
// into arrival_heard in one statement. The office writes the answer and never
// reads it back, on either road.
