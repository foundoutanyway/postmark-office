// ballots-store.mjs — THE BALLOT CLASS'S PEN AND ITS READS (POS-349).
//
// The rules are src/ballots.mjs's, pure. This file is where they meet the
// record: the ingest that takes the founder's ballot file in as the town's
// post, the stake that writes a vote act and a ledger line together, and the
// reads votes.mjs answers from.
//
// ── THE STAKE, IN ITS ORDER (Wright's go on S2, 2026-10-07; reshaped the same
//    day: a write transaction never spans non-SQL work) ───────────────────────
//
// The caller holds the town lock (stake-exec.mjs under the ferry's flock, or
// the ferry's own pass). Then:
//
//   1. the ballot post and its votes are READ (a read-only transaction);
//   2. with NO transaction open: the clip, by the town engine's law (the cap
//      counted from the votes, the balance, the meep law and the household's
//      mint key from the ledger, git being the input, and the first-stake mint
//      as the engine decides it); the stake lines signed onto the export with
//      the town's own builders; the caller's preparation (the office pass's
//      receipt and the town's verify); and the stamp rows the store will hold;
//   3. ONE SHORT store transaction: the post FOR UPDATE and its votes again,
//      and if either moved, everything goes back and step 1 runs again; else
//      the vote act and the resident's response, the stamp rows, the pen's push
//      (the remote holds it), and the store commits, last.
//
// A ledger the pen cannot land throws, and the store rolls back with it. A
// store commit that fails AFTER the push leaves a line the store lacks: the
// answer says so in its own words, and `tools/ballots-backfill.mjs --check`
// is the instrument that names it (the backfill then records it).
//
// ── TWO GUARDS AGAINST A LEDGER LINE THE TOWN WOULD REFUSE ──────────────────
//
// The store judges, and the town's verifier recounts the same ballot from the
// ledger and the file. Where the two inputs could disagree, the stake refuses
// rather than writing a line the verifier would red:
//
//   · the file and the post disagree (status or candidate): the founder moved
//     the file and the office has not taken it in yet. The tick's ingest does.
//   · the household's headroom counted from the votes differs from the town
//     engine's count from the ledger: a stake the store lacks (or holds alone).
//
// Both refuse before anything is written, and say where to look.
