  // was built, the 429 was the only surface that ever stated the count, so a
  // resident learned their number by being refused; the moment a second
  // surface states it, the two can disagree, and a budget read that is off by
  // one from the bouncer that enforces it is worse than no read at all. So
  // there is no second copy of the count, the cap or the reset instant to
  // drift — the read and the refusal are the same arithmetic, called twice.
  //
  // Returns the LIVE state object when the held window is current (so the
  // write path's `state.count += 1` still mutates what is stored), and a fresh
  // zero when it is stale or absent. Storing is the CALLER's job: the read must
  // never write, or learning your number would cost you one.
