// bugs.mjs — THE BUG CLASS OF THE POST MACHINE (Posts phase 2, first slice), pure.
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-29 (the Posts project, § Ruled for phase 2): "Bugs pay the
// flat ladder, with no staking … it feels odd to wait for stakers for a clearly
// broken thing that just needs fixing, and ideally every bug gets fixed
// anyway." The first slice is the bug class plus a mint Wright reviews before
// it writes.
//
// ── THE LIFECYCLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   reported → confirmed → reproduced → diagnosed → briefed → fixed → shipped
//
// with two side exits from reported or confirmed: `duplicate` (naming the post
// it duplicates, `of`) and `not-a-bug`. Finished: shipped, duplicate, not-a-bug.
//
// Any resident posts a bug as themselves. The town's hands (BUG_HANDS) move it,
// and may also post one on a resident's behalf (`for`), crediting the reporter.
// An advance may jump forward; a stage it skips pays nothing.
//
// ── THE ADVANCE RECORDS; IT MINTS NOTHING ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Each advance act names the stage and whom it credits (`credit`), and at
// `briefed` the grade, at `fixed` the size and the critter the fixer named
// (POS-298; kept as fields.critter with fields.named_by). What a stage pays is the ladder
// below, and it is paid by a separate, reviewed pass (tools/bug-stage-plan.mjs)
// that reads these acts, so a door call never moves money. The town's own
// ledger holds the ladder again at verify (its stamp-mint.mjs § the stage
// grammar), so an amount this file and the town disagree on reds the verifier.
//
// ── NO STAKE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A bug takes no stake, at post and at the stake door alike, refused by name
// (BUG_NO_STAKE), with the ruling's reason in the refusal.

// ── THE JAR'S ORDER (POS-558, Wright's review of #481, 2026-10-10) ──────────
//
// The bug read pages, so its order is what a resident walks page after page,
// and it is the jar's, in four groups:
//
//   1. open bugs, the furthest stage first (fixed … reported)
//   2. finished bugs with a name (a critter), the caught ones in the jar
//   3. the legacy shelf: finished with no name (fixed or shipped without a
//      critter; a critter is named only at fixed, so these never will be)
//   4. set aside: duplicate, not a bug
//
// newest first within each (the post's latest act), then by id. This order is
// the bug read's own; the shared postOrder, which events and quests read, is
// untouched.

// ── THE CATCHERS (POS-558, Darko 2026-10-10) ────────────────────────────────
//
// "The Bug Catchers' Hall of Fame … residents in order of amount of stamp
// contribution towards bugs." The bug read pages (town-posts.mjs § THE BUG
// READ PAGES), and a page cannot add up the town, so every page carries the
// totals over the whole record, from the same history credits and
// stamps_paid: one row per handle credited on any bug,
//
//   { handle, stamps, bugs }
//
//   stamps  the sum of stamps_paid on the history rows that credit them; null
//           when the chain cannot be read (the read's `unavailable`), never 0
//   bugs    the posts they hold a credit on (the post's row credits its reporter)
//
// A bug set aside (duplicate, not a bug) credits only a stage that paid: a
// withdrawn report is not a catch. Every credited handle is listed, the town's
// hands too; whom to rank is the reader's call (the site ranks no meep and no
// founder). Ordered by stamps, then bugs, then handle.

/** The Hall's totals over every bug post (each carrying its `history`), PURE. */
