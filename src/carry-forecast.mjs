// carry-forecast.mjs — WHAT A MOVE WILL CARRY, said at the door (POS-441).
//
// The carry itself is decided at the clearing, in the window's transaction,
// against the store's pre-state (world2/tools/carry.mjs). The door cannot know
// that state — a housemate may place a mark inside before the window closes —
// so what it says is a FORECAST, labelled as one (R11's courtesy layer: a
// forecast, never a refusal), read from the World the door already serves:
//
//   · inside by geometry — the published fold's own `placementParent` on each
//     mark, walked up (the fold's containment answer; no geometry is computed
//     here, which keeps the 2026-08-22 "a draft costs nothing" ruling whole);
//   · inside by filing — the frozen manifest's directory edge, the one the
//     printout composes a nested file's numbers against;
//   · the household — the fold's `declared_household` (its resolver's answer),
//     falling back to the mark's own `household`.
//
// The sentence is carry.mjs's, so the door and the clearing say one thing in
// two tenses.
