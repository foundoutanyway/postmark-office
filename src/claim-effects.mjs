// claim-effects.mjs — a crossing publishing or refusing your mark is an EFFECT
// ON YOUR NODE, and `since:` now says so.
//
// THE CLAUSE THIS REPAIRS, verbatim, from `LOGOS/the-response-function §
// Residents: words, at their own pace`:
//
//   the resident's loop is "a replayable, cursor-ordered read of every effect
//   on your own node since you last looked"
//
// The 2026-09-06 walk asked `world { since: 170 }` after staking a mark and
// living through two crossings, and got:
//
//   happened.to_you: { complete: true, note: "complete by construction — frame
//   events are rare, so yours are never truncated", count: 0, events: [] }
//
// A completeness guarantee, over an empty list, about a resident whose stake
// had just been ruled on. The guarantee was TRUE about the shelf it was written
// for — frame edges and carried legs — and FALSE about the shelf a resident
// reads it as. The repair is both halves: the events, and a `complete` that
// stops being unconditional.
//
// ── THREE EVENTS, AND WHY NOT MORE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   claim-pending    you (or somebody standing on your ground) put a mark
//                    forward; it is on the public docket and rides a candle
//   claim-locked     the candle ruled FOR it
//   claim-refused    the candle ruled AGAINST it, with the cause in the
//                    bulletin's own five words
//
// A `draft` writes no event: it is private, it has happened to nobody, and an
// event for it would be the town narrating a resident's own compose space back
// at them. `retracted` writes none either — the resident did it, and the
// backlog is for what happened TO you.
//
// ── THE CURSOR IS THE FERRY'S CROSSING, AND IT IS SAID SO ──────────────────
//
// `since:` is the world's 00:00/12:00Z crossing (`crossings.mjs §
// CROSSING_DERIVATION`), not the settlement epoch and not the candle's window.
// Every event here therefore carries BOTH: `crossing` (the cursor's clock, so
// the caller can page) and `window` (the candle's, so the receipt beside it
// lines up). Naming one and printing the other is the R4 finding.

//
// `happened.town.headlines` answered `[]` at crossing 172 — the crossing right
// after a settlement published five marks — because its only source was the
// standing PSA board. A standing notice is not news, and both weekend walks
// found the hole from opposite ends: *"the doorstep tells me everything about
// me and nothing about the town"* and *"the town has a heartbeat you can count
// and no news you can read."*
//
// The crossing's own published/refused list IS the news, and the store has held
// it all along. POINTERS, NEVER COPIES — the shelf's own standing rule — so
// each row is an id, a word, and the read that opens it.

/**
 * THE DOORSTEP'S `rulings` SEGMENT — what the last crossings ruled on my
 * things, one line each.
 *
 * SAME DERIVATION as `since:`'s claim effects: `readClaimEffects` is the one
 * place a claim row becomes an event, and this segment reads it rather than
 * asking the same question a second way. Two derivations of one question is how
 * `stances_awaiting` came to have two counts on two doors with no word saying
 * whose ground each counted (walk of 2026-09-05, item 3).
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS THE LAST TWO CROSSINGS, not a cursor: a doorstep is a morning
 * page, not a backlog. A resident who wants the whole delta has `since:`, and
 * this segment names it in `serves` so they can walk there.
 *
 * ── BOTH AXES, AND THE SECOND WAS PROMISED AND NOT WIRED ──────────────────
 *
 * Repaired 2026-09-07 on the reviewer's finding. This function called
 * `readClaimEffects` with no `onMyGround`, so it defaulted to an empty Set —
 * and that is not a cosmetic omission, it is structural in two places at once:
 * `claimRowsSince` was called with `slugs: []`, so the rows never left the
 * store, and `claimEffectsFrom`'s `if (!isMine && !onGround) continue` dropped
 * any that had. **A mark somebody else laid over your ground could never appear
 * here.**
 *
 * The door's own description promised exactly that axis — "every mark of yours,
 * AND every mark laid over ground you hold" — and the commit that added it
 * argued the bare-vs-named scoping on the same axis ("a narrower default hides
 * a housemate's refusal from the house that shares the ground"). A door saying
 * something true-sounding about itself that nobody asked the record to confirm
 * is the class this lane was chartered to fix, introduced by this lane.
 *
 * The ground set comes from the CONSENT INBOX, exactly as `world-apex.mjs §
 * happenedFor` builds it — `stancesForHandles` already answers "what has been
 * laid over ground you hold", and one question must not have two derivations
 * that disagree (#1044's lesson, and `stances_awaiting`'s two counts).
