// creature-tick.mjs — the creatures' own clock: each window's seed, its spawns,
// their fades and the window's reveal, written by `the-town` (WLD-56 part 3).
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-15 12:09 EDT, WLD-56 D1–D6, as recommended): per 12 h
// window a wolf 2, a raven 4 and a bat 3, each at its own seeded minute, in the
// 400 m fringe on the clear side of the Mists' wall, open country only. Each
// lasts 12 h from its own spawn minute, then fades (withdraw, reason `faded`),
// or leaves early if it flees (`fled`, the creature's own row, POS-637). So
// creatures overlap across a crossing rather than turning over at once. No
// movement in w44: a creature stands where it spawned.
//
// Engineering settled by Wright on WLD-56 (W1–W8, from the gap read):
//
//   · W3  THE WRITER, NOT THE SWEEP. Spawns fall at set minutes through a 12 h
//         window, so a twice-a-day sweep cannot make them. This tick runs in the
//         writer process beside the arrival tick, every CREATURE_TICK_MS.
//   · W2  THE SEED: COMMIT, THEN REVEAL. At the window's first tick `the-town`
//         writes a `seed` act: the blessed world sha the window is pinned to, and
//         sha256(secret_N | sha). After the window closes it writes a `reveal`
//         act carrying secret_N, and anyone re-derives the whole window with the
//         world's `auditWindow`. secret_N = HMAC(CREATURE_SEED_KEY, N), and the
//         key is the box's alone (the office unit's env).
//   · W4  NO NEW TABLE. Every row is an `acts` row of class `creature` (R6):
//           seed     the-town · object window-<N> · { crossing, world_sha, commitment }
//           spawn    the-town · object <creature id> · { kind, crossing, x, y, at, fades_at, moods, flags }
//           withdraw the-town · object <creature id> · { reason: "faded", fades_at }
//           reveal   the-town · object window-<N> · { crossing, secret }
//         `at` on a spawn is its scheduled minute; the row is dated when it was
//         written (the log is never back-dated, world tools/creatures.mjs).
//   · W6  OFF UNTIL THE TOWN SAYS SO. The creature class's `from_crossing`
//         dial, read at the blessed sha, is null: no seed, no spawn. A window
//         that would spawn nothing (off, out of the Mists' season) is not seeded.
//
// EVERYTHING ABOUT A WINDOW IS READ AT ITS SEED'S SHA: the world's own code
// (`tools/creatures.mjs`, `tools/creature-kind.mjs`), the creature law (the class
// marks under CREATURE_LAW_DIR), the skeleton's Mists and the town's marks (the
// keep-out). A blessing that lands mid-window moves nothing already committed
// to. The world's code is never read from the working tree.
//
// NEVER TWICE. Each write takes an advisory lock on (action, object) and looks
// for the row first, inside one transaction, so a restart, a crash between two
// writes, or two offices overlapping at a deploy cannot write a row twice.
//
// THE KEY IS SEEN IN THE RECORD, NEVER SHOWN (review of #572, L1–L3).
//   · Every seed carries `key_fingerprint` (sha256 of HMAC(key, "creatures/
//     fingerprint")), so a key changed between windows shows in the log as two
//     fingerprints, though neither tells the key.
//   · A WRONG KEY WRITES NOTHING FOR A WINDOW IT DID NOT COMMIT. Before a window's
//     spawns or its reveal, the secret the key derives must hash, with the seed's
//     sha, to the seed's commitment: a spawn the commitment does not cover would
//     fail the audit, and so would a reveal. If it does not (the key was rotated
//     mid-window), the tick writes ONE `abandon` row for that window, by the-town,
//     with both fingerprints, and logs a fault once. The window is then closed:
//     no more spawns, no reveal, and its creatures already out still fade. It is
//     not held for ever with a line every 30 s.
//   · FADES NEED NO KEY. Without CREATURE_SEED_KEY the clock still runs and writes
//     the fades, so no creature outlives its span in the written fold; only the
//     seed, the spawns and the reveal wait for the key.
//
// Env: CREATURE_SEED_KEY (the box's master key; absent, only the fades run),
// CREATURE_TICK=off (the operator's door).
