// creatures-hook.mjs — the creatures in the writer process (POS-637 PR-B, part 3 of 4).
//
// RULED (Darko, Sitting E 2026-10-14; C1–C6 2026-10-15 12:09 EDT, as
// recommended). The core (creatures.mjs) judges one act for every creature
// whose ring holds it. This file is what puts it to work:
//
//   · THE PROCESS'S CREATURES. One LivingSet, folded from `acts` every
//     REFRESH_MS beside the arrival tick, under the world's law at the blessed
//     ref (creatureLaw). A new blessing builds a new set under the new law.
//     While no creature is living, act-watch.mjs is told so, and every act door
//     is its plain self.
//   · THE ACT DOORS (W1). act-watch.mjs § perceived hands this file the rows an
//     act wrote. The trigger is the last row whose action the world's law
//     perceives (RING_VERBS), so a walk that exits first is one walk, and a
//     stake that releases a draft's leave-mark is that leave-mark. Where the
//     actor stood is the row's own witnessed point, else (an enter or exit,
//     which carries none) the actor's standpoint. The act's instant is its
//     row's own `at` (carry 2): a row read back without one is no trigger.
//   · THE ANSWER WAITS AT MOST ANSWER_WAIT_MS (W2). The creatures' turns run
//     outside the door's retry key and outside the watched act (carry 3), so
//     their rows are never taken for the act's. A turn still running at the
//     deadline finishes on its own: its row lands and stands in
//     happening_here; the answer goes out without it.
//   · THE ARRIVAL (C1, RULED: "the walk is seen both when it's declared and
//     when it lands"). The same tick reads every walk act by a cursor, works
//     out where and when it lands (the engine's own positionAt), and at that
//     instant judges it for any creature whose ring holds the landing point.
//     A later walk by the same walker replaces it, as a later departure
//     replaces an arrival's entry (Darko's G4 on WLD-5). The reaction's row
//     names the walk act and the moment, so a creature answers a walk at most
//     once when it is declared and once when it lands.
//   · THE CREATURE'S OWN WORLD READ (W9, Darko 21:32). `aroundCreature` asks
//     the resident read's own doors at the creature's point, as a spectator
//     (nobody's body, nobody's note): presence and who acted (who), the field
//     of view with its bodies (view), the shared ear that marks nobody present
//     (heard, office#564), the air, the hour, and what the actor last did.
//     One reader for residents and creatures.
//   · A CREATURE'S VIEW IS KEPT, NOT RE-SEEN ON THE ACT (play row 51,
//     2026-10-15). The field of view is the expensive part of that read: the
//     engine's line of sight over the whole world, about 270 ms of synchronous
//     work per standpoint, plus ~110 ms of a blocking `git` in markRecords,
//     measured in the playground. A creature does not move (WLD-56 D3), and
//     what it can see changes only with the published world or the crossing, so
//     the tick sees for each living creature once per (published sha,
//     crossing), off the act's path, and the act reads what it saw. Three
//     creatures seeing on the act's path held the thread 1.2–1.7 s, so the
//     1 s answer had no time left for Jev and code judged every reaction.
//
// TWO OFFICES AT ONCE (a deploy's overlap): both fold the same rows and both
// may judge one arrival. creatures.mjs § writeReaction locks on (creature,
// trigger, moment) inside its transaction, so the second finds the first's row.
