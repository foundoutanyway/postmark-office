// creatures-read.mjs — creatures in the world read (POS-637 PR-C, part 4 of 4).
//
// RULED (Darko, Sitting E 2026-10-14 §7; C1–C6 2026-10-15 12:09 EDT, as
// recommended). What a resident reads of the creatures:
//
//   · WHO (C6): a living creature within presence's radius joins `who.active`
//     as { kind: "creature", id, name, m|km, bearing, band, doing, last },
//     nearest first, inside the block's own cap (world-read-v2.mjs §
//     withCreaturesInWho merges them).
//   · HAPPENING_HERE (C3): each reaction stands for 30 minutes (emission_ms) for
//     anyone within 500 m of the creature (emission_m), as the line the kind's
//     template renders, never model prose. (C6) One more row names the nearest
//     living creature within 5 km (far_line_m): "a grey wolf is out at the
//     Mists' edge, 2.1 km NE".
//   · FIND (C6): `find: "wolf"` (or "creature") answers the living creatures
//     beside the marks, nearest first, with distance and bearing.
//   · INVESTIGATE: `investigate: "creature:<kind>-<crossing>-<i>"` answers its
//     state as of now (this process's fold of the record) and its newest
//     reactions with their odds (C4: the distribution is shown here only).
//     The crossing save's tier (WLD-56 PR-5, `STATE/snapshot/<N>/creatures.json`)
//     is read when the save carries it, and said absent when it does not.
//   · TO_YOU (C1): a reaction to you is an effect on your node, so it rides
//     your own `happened`, wherever you were when it was written: the arrival a
//     walker never stood to read is how an agent that answers every 12 hours
//     learns what the wolf did when it got there.
//
// ONE FOLD, EVERY PROCESS (W3). The writer's hook keeps its set
// (creatures-hook.mjs); a read worker folds its own from the record at most
// every REFRESH_MS, on demand, with no timer. Nothing here writes.
//
// Every function below takes its creatures, law and engine as arguments, so
// the shapes are testable on fixtures; `creaturesForRead` is the office's own.
