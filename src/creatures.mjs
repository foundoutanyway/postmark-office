// creatures.mjs — creatures from the Mists, the office half (POS-637; Sitting E,
// docs/2026-10-14/halloween/sitting-E-entities.md §§ 6–7).
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-14 21:31–21:32 EDT): a creature is a smart decoration
// with an AWARENESS RING. It has no verbs of its own: every ordinary public act a
// resident takes inside the ring has an effect, even a walk. Code checks the
// ring, so nothing outside it costs a judgment. Inside it, Jev answers a Choice
// over the reactions whose `when` holds, plus the moods' Scores, and a public
// d20 samples the Choice. The reaction comes back in the actor's own answer as
// one line from the kind's templates, and stands for everyone nearby as an
// emission. A creature has its own world read: structured data about where it
// stands. No combat, no harm, no tamed or befriended state; "creatures", never
// "critters".
//
// THIS FILE IS THE CORE (PR-A, part 1 of 3), and nothing calls it yet. PR-B
// wraps the six act implementations around `reactTo` and puts its lines in each
// answer; PR-C reads creatures into `who`, `happening_here` and `investigate`.
// The shapes it holds were settled on POS-637 (W1–W10, Wright 10-14 22:0x):
//
//   · W3  the living set, the caps and each creature's memory are a FOLD of
//         `acts`, kept in RAM: a `(class, id)` cursor every REFRESH_MS, plus the
//         process's own writes. Nothing here is stored anywhere else.
//   · W2  Jev is asked with no store connection held, and a judgment that fails
//         or is late is answered by code. A creature can never fail an act:
//         `reactTo` resolves, it does not throw.
//   · W4  one `acts` row per reaction (actor = the creature, action `react`,
//         object = the trigger act's id), idempotent by (creature, trigger). It
//         never carries Jev's slice, because `acts` is published by the notary
//         and the slice quotes other residents. `flee` writes the creature's own
//         `withdraw` (reason `fled`) in the same transaction.
//   · W5  the d20 is 1 + sha256(creature · trigger act · trigger stamp) mod 20:
//         the server's stamp, re-derivable from the log, never shown to Jev.
//   · W6  one promise chain per creature, so its moods change in act order.
//         The Score sets a mood first, then the picked reaction's effects apply
//         (the Spire prototype's order).
//   · W7  CREATURE_JUDGE = jev | code | off (default jev) is the operator's
//         door; TYPESAFE_API_KEY is the office env's.
//
// PENDING (Darko's Call, C1–C6 on POS-637): the dials below marked `pending`
// carry the lane's recommendation as the default until he rules. Changing one
// is a one-line PR; nothing else reads the number.
//
// THE KIND IS THE WORLD'S, READ BY THE WORLD'S OWN CODE (PR-A2; Wright, no
// adapter; Starstory docs/2026-10-13/rail/WLD-56/shape-check-561.md). The
// office imports `tools/creature-kind.mjs` (parseKind, scopeOf,
// allowedReactions, applyEffects, voiceLine, RING_VERBS) and
// `tools/creatures.mjs` (TOWN, DESPAWN_REASONS, isCreatureId) at the BLESSED ref, and keeps
// only what is the office's: the ring's RAM, the caps, Jev, the d20, the slice
// and the row. A kind is `WORLD/kinds/<kind>.kind` at the same ref. Until a
// blessing carries `tools/creature-kind.mjs`, `loadCreatureLaw` answers
// `unavailable` and nothing reacts: FAIL CLOSED, never the working tree.
//
// THE ROWS IT FOLDS (class `creature`; WLD-56 W4, F3, F6):
//   spawn     actor the-town, object = the creature id, payload { kind, at, x, y, fades_at, moods, flags };
//             `at` (its minute) and `fades_at` are both required: a spawn without them is skipped
//   react     actor = the creature, object = the trigger act id, payload as `reactionPayload`
//   withdraw  object = the creature id, actor the-town or the creature itself,
//             payload { reason: "faded" | "fled" }; any other withdraw is ignored
