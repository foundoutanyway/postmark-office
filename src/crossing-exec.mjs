// crossing-exec.mjs — one crossing, appended, under the caller's flock.
//
// DEMO SLICE (gold plan postmark-world-view-system, step 5 — the enter/exit
// pair, ruled in the 2026-08-18 wind-down and NOT yet planted in LOGOS). This
// file exists on `jetto/enter-exit-demo` and merges nowhere: verbs-before-law
// would break the TDD method, so the pen is written and left standing.
//
// It is walk-exec.mjs's sibling and deliberately its twin, because a crossing
// is the same KIND of fact as a departure: declared once, at the moment it is
// declared, into an append-only public record — and everything after it derives.
// Occupancy is never stored. The `contains` edge with the entity child that R14
// makes a crossing MEAN is derived from these lines by tools/thresholds.mjs, in
// every reader, exactly as position is derived from the walk ledger's.
//
// It appends ONE OR MORE lines and commits: one per link of the chain, because
// deep entry is a chain of crossings and each link is separately adjudicated —
// so a chain that was refused at its third door writes two crossings and a
// refusal, which is precisely what happened and precisely what the record
// should hold.
//
// The grammar travels with the clone (`tools/thresholds.mjs` imported FROM the
// world clone, as walk-exec imports the clone's walk.mjs): the enforcer and the
// record must agree, and the clone owns both.
//
// Env: WORLD_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1 to push, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's).
// Exit 0 with { lines, at, within, commit, pushed } or { error }.
