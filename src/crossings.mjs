// crossings.mjs — the town clock, in one place.
//
// The RATIFIED derivation (Keemin, 2026-07-29), lifted VERBATIM out of
// src/world.mjs when a second reader needed it. Its own words, unchanged:
//
//   "Fog is the crossing's weather and seeds from the crossing number
//    (ENGINE.md). The ruling: crossings run 00:00 / 12:00 UTC (the ferry's
//    clock), counted from the mail-ledger's first delivery day (2026-06-12).
//    This derivation IS the town clock; raw ferry-run counts (which include
//    off-timetable catch-up boats) are operational history, not the calendar.
//    Crossing 100 lands 2026-08-01 00:00 UTC."
//
// WHY IT MOVED. `world.mjs` is 1,600 lines that open a sqlite store, resolve a
// world clone, and pull in graphology at import — so a small tool that needs
// nothing but "how many crossings old is this?" could not import it without
// dragging the whole world in. The two honest options were a second copy of the
// arithmetic (which is how two clocks are born) or this file. `world.mjs` now
// imports and re-exports `currentCrossing`, so every existing caller is
// untouched and there is still exactly one place the ruling lives.
//
// FIRST OUTSIDE CALLER: tools/stripe-watch.mjs, whose grace window before a card
// payment becomes a receipt is measured in crossings.

// 2026-06-12T00:00Z — the mail-ledger's first delivery day.

//
// Pica: "show when the next ferry crossing is on the doorstep or send receipt,
// so you know if your letter makes this crossing or waits." The office already
// kept this clock in two files — the number here, and `write.mjs § nextCrossing`
// walking its own `CROSSINGS_UTC = [0, 12]` for the next instant — and two
// files with one clock is how a doorstep and a receipt come to name different
// boats. The instant is derived HERE, from the same epoch and interval the
// number is, and write.mjs's `nextCrossing` now reads it.
//
// `crossing` is the number of the boat: the ratified derivation above says
// "Crossing 100 lands 2026-08-01 00:00 UTC" — crossing N lands at
// epoch + N × 12h — so the boat that sails at the end of the current interval
// is `currentCrossing() + 1`. The doorstep and the receipt both name it, which
// is what lets a writer tell whether the boat their morning page named is the
// one their letter caught: same number, same boat.
//
// A letter rides the first crossing after the instant it is written. There is
// no cutoff to invent: the ferry drains the town log when it runs
// (deploy/postmark-ferry.service), so a letter logged before 00:00Z is aboard
// and one logged after waits for 12:00Z — exactly what "the next crossing after
// now" says. `minutes_away` is rounded UP so a reader at 11:59:30Z is told 1,
// never 0, and it is a number about the instant the page was composed.
