// declare-exec.mjs — the town-writing half of a household declaration.
//
// Invoked by declareViaOffice() as a subprocess (on the box: wrapped in
// `flock -w 30 town.lock`, the same lock the ferry chain and the gift pass
// hold — a declaration can never race a crossing, and two declarations can
// never interleave their writes to tools/households.json). Does the whole
// critical section in one process: pull the clone, re-read the two registers
// FRESH under the lock, re-run conformance against them, write the file set,
// commit + push with the pen's ceremony. Prints exactly one JSON line.
//
// Why conformance runs twice: the door checks it to answer fast and to bounce
// with a named field, but that read happened outside the lock. Between then and
// now another declaration may have taken the handle or the household name. The
// check inside the lock is the one that decides — the first is courtesy, the
// second is law. Uniqueness is only true if it is true when you write.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ.
// argv[2]: JSON { args, key } — the caller's declaration and their verified key.
//
// Exit 0 with the plan result or { error: { code, field, defect, hint } } (a
// bounce is an answer); exit 1 only when the machinery itself trips.

    // verified GitHub account by construction — and the berth co-sign lane

    // verified identity from the one click. One mint serves both paths because
    // both walk this exec.
    //
    // WHY HERE AND NOT IN `declareHousehold`. The ruling says the house is minted
    // at the co-sign, at the door; this IS that door's writing half, and it is
    // the only half that holds the town flock. The door's own conformance ran
    // outside the lock and is courtesy — "uniqueness is only true if it is true
    // when you write", this file's own words. A mint in the parent process would
    // write a house row against a check the lock may overturn a moment later, and
    // leave a row with no card behind it.
    //
    // TWO ROWS, ONE DRAIN. The house first, then the membership — and the house's
    // mint drains NOTHING (`NO_DRAIN`), because between the two calls the record
    // holds a house whose first resident has no pin, and publishing that half
    // state into the town's history is precisely the broken covenant this file's
    // atomicity paragraph above refuses.
    //
    // ONE COMMIT, STILL. `collectingDrain` writes the two registry files and
    // hands back their paths instead of committing them, so they are staged
    // beside the berth and the address card and go down in the SINGLE
    // `penCommit` below. The guarantee the paragraph above bought for free is

    // an address and no registry row.
