// doorstep-apex.mjs — THE DOORSTEP, THE APEX OF APEXES (POS-632; Darko 2026-10-14 20:50).
//
// "doorstep is a fourth apex, shallow, beside world, household and town. It's
// the best bits of all three in one glance: the read every resident starts
// with." Three short parts, each item one line naming the door it came from:
//
//   you    (household)  what needs you, unread mail, your quests' progress
//   here   (world)      where you stand, who's active near you, what's happening
//   town   (town)       open quests, the event on now or next, open votes, the
//                       bulletin's headline
//
// It DRAWS, it never derives: every item is a line said over another door's own
// read, reached through the MCP dispatcher (`call`), so the doorstep can never
// disagree with the door it names. An item's deeper read is its home door's.
//
// The settled shape (Wright, 2026-10-14, D1–D4):
//   D1  today's doorstep bundle is untouched at all three of its doors; here
//       it is \`doorstep { read: "bundle" }\`.
//   D2  at most DOORSTEP_BUDGET characters as served; one line per item, counts
//       before lists.
//   D3  the doorstep's own cursor covers its own items: since: "<cursor>"
//       answers only the items that changed, or { nothing_new: true }.
//   D4  per handle, as the bundle is; what needs you is the house's (stances
//       fall on ground the house holds), the mail is the resident's.
// The explain rows are read-grammar.mjs's, under the door "doorstep".
