// doorstep-bundle.mjs — the doorstep, whole, for every door that serves it.
//
// The founder, 2026-08-25: the doorstep is "really just a bundle of other mcp
// read calls." `queries.mjs § doorstep` builds the segments — each one the
// answer of the read its `serves` names. This file adds the four blocks that
// are NOT segments because no other read serves them, and it exists so that
// there is exactly ONE place where a doorstep is finished:
//
//   read_doorstep (MCP flat)  ·  household read: "doorstep"  ·  GET /doorstep/{h}
//
// Before this, two of those three each carried their own copy of the garnish
// sequence — forty lines apiece, with a comment on each explaining that they
// had to stay in step. They did not, once: the hot-tense block shipped on the
// MCP doorstep alone, so a resident who edited through REST and read back
// through REST was told nothing about their own pending edit — the one caller
// the disclosure exists for. Parity is one call site, not two renderings of one
// idea that a reviewer has to compare.
//
// THE OWNERSHIP GATE, in one place too (the 08-15 ruling: "the gaps are yours
// to see, not theirs to be seen by"). The gap-shaped blocks ride only your own
// doorstep; a stranger's read carries exactly what the public bundle carries.

  // it. `nowMs` is that one instant, and the default is the wall clock, so a
  // caller who passes nothing gets what it always got.
  //
  // It is spelled `nowMs`, not `now`, because both spellings already mean
  // something in this chain and they are DIFFERENT TYPES: `queries.doorstep`

  // Date. One name for two types is how a caller hands a Date to arithmetic.

  // under `as_of`, on every skin and every door, because it is the one number
  // a writer reads BEFORE writing: the boat's number, when it sails, how many
  // minutes off, and the sentence. The receipt names the same boat by the same
  // number (`crossings.mjs § nextCrossingForReceipt`), so "did my letter make
  // the crossing my morning page named" is answered by comparing two integers.
  //
  // NOT A SEGMENT: no other read serves it, so it lives here with `psa`,
  // `counts` and the rest of the page that has no other door. It is a live

  // (its own history: the newest change, and the newest crossing's seal) and
  // says, in plain words and in fields, whether that copy holds the last
  // crossing the timetable has sailed (crossings.mjs § copyBlock). Every skin,

  // ── THE SEVENTH SEGMENT · what awaits your word (the founder's .1 ruling) ─
  //
  // It is attached here rather than in `doorstep()` because it is the one
  // segment the OFFICE INDEX cannot answer: the consent inbox is derived by the
  // world engine from mark geometry, which is async and can be genuinely
  // unreadable. Everything else about it is an ordinary segment — same
  // `serves`/`args` pointer, same bound, same falsifier.
  //
  // ⚠ THE SUBJECT NOTE, the same one the `stamps` segment carries. The
  // household read is scoped to your whole HOUSE by default; this page is about
  // one PERSON, so the segment names `handle:` explicitly and the pointer says
  // so. Ask `household { read: "stances", handle: … }` yourself and you get
  // this object back — the narrowing is in the args, not in a second rule.
  //
  // ALWAYS PRESENT, even when the world is down: `stancesForHandles` never
  // throws and answers `unavailable` instead. A morning page that dropped this
  // segment when the engine was mid-write would tell a resident that nothing
  // awaits their word, which is precisely the silence the segment exists to end.
  //
  // ── THE TEACHING BLOCK IS NOT ON THIS PAGE (conductor's call, 2026-09-07) ──
  //
  // `teach` — what a stance DOES, and the unruled pair it is caught between —
  // rides `household { read: "stances" }` whole and reaches the doorstep as ONE
  // POINTER LINE. Three reasons, and the third is the one that decides it:
  // it is the largest block this lane adds to the morning page by bytes; it is
  // byte-identical for every resident every day, so a reader who has seen it
  // once has seen it forever; and it TEACHES rather than REPORTS, which is the
  // one thing a morning page is not for. The doorstep is the surface
  // little-bird abandoned as too heavy, and a fix for a resident's confusion
  // that makes their morning page heavier has traded one complaint for another.
  //
  // The pointer is not a summary of the block. It names the question and the
  // door, and nothing else — a paraphrase here would be the copy-nothing-keeps-
  // honest defect that this whole teaching block exists to avoid.
  // ⚠ AND IT IS CUT ON THE SLIM SKIN ONLY, which is not a softening of the
  // call — it is the only lawful place to make it. The bundle's own law is that
  // a segment IS the read its `serves` names, deep-equal, so that asking the
  // read yourself returns the same object; two falsifiers hold it
  // (doorstep-bundle.test.mjs § THE BUNDLE, doorstep-stances.test.mjs § THE
  // BUNDLE LAW HOLDS HERE TOO). Trimming the REST page would have broken that
  // law to save bytes on the skin that is not the heavy one. The connector skin
  // is where the weight actually lands, it already drops fat blocks by design
  // (queries.mjs § slimAwaiting, § slimPsa), and every cut it makes is NAMED on
  // the page — so the cut goes there, named, and the REST bundle still answers
  // exactly what `household { read: "stances" }` answers.
