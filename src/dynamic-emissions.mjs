// dynamic-emissions.mjs — speech as an EMISSION, and threads as a query over it.
//
// An emission is a thing that HAPPENS. Its PRESENCE lives in the store under a
// TTL and then it is gone, exactly the way air clears; its OCCURRENCE is an
// event in the crossing log, and that is kept forever. Presence fades;
// occurrence is history (LOGOS/lifetimes.md).
//
// That one law shapes every function here:
//
//   · `recordEmission` writes a row whose TTL is the sound class's, read from
//     the class mark — the dial is the town's law, not this file's opinion.
//   · `presentEmissions` answers PRESENCE as a QUERY over born_at/ttl, never as
//     a delete. Nothing is removed when it expires.
//   · `pruneEmissions` is the only deleter, and it refuses to touch anything the
//     crossing-save has not already crystallized into the world repo. Presence
//     may be lost; occurrence may not be lost before it is history.
//
// ── ON NOT REIMPLEMENTING THE THREAD DERIVATION ─────────────────────────────
//
// `threadsFrom` runs the office's OWN `clusterVoices` over rows projected out of
// the store. That is deliberate, and it is world-serve.mjs's rule applied one
// layer down: the store supplies the FACTS, the shipped derivation supplies the
// MATHS. A second clustering implementation here would make the parity harness
// measure whether two transcriptions of one algorithm agree — which is not the
// question. The question is whether the store's rows are the same speech the
// voices log holds, and that is falsified by a missing field, not by a missing
// formula.
//
// The spike proved how easy the alternative is to get wrong: reading earshot as
// overlapping circles, dropping the deck rule, or closing threads at the hearing
// TTL instead of the conversation window each produced a believable-looking
// conversations page and a different set of threads.
