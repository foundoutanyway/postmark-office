// dynamic-entities.mjs — residents become ENTITIES: rows whose position is
// STATE, not identity.
//
// The derivation, end to end:
//
//   world.db `events` (the walk ledger, hydrated) -> the governing departure per
//   actor -> tools/walk.mjs `positionAt(departure, clock)` -> one entities row
//
// Three laws this module obeys, all of them from LOGOS/kinds.md:
//
//   1. LATEST WINS. A resident's current departure is their last recorded one.
//      Superseding is a new departure from the derived position, never a
//      mutation of an old one.
//   2. AN ENTITY HAS NO GEOMETRIC PARENT, EVER. Nothing here writes a
//      containment edge, and the entities table has no parent column to write
//      one into. "What am I within" is a query over position.
//   3. THE RECORD TRAVELS WITH THE POSITION. Every row carries the departure it
//      was derived from and the instant it was evaluated, because position is
//      derived — a row of bare coordinates cannot be carried forward to any
//      other clock, and the crossing-save's whole loss story depends on it
//      being able to.
//
// The physics is NOT reimplemented here. `positionAt` is imported from the
// world's own `tools/walk.mjs` — at a ref, never from the working tree, the
// same discipline world.mjs's `engineDir()` uses — so the office cannot quietly
// disagree with the world about where anyone is.

// This did a git ref read, a tree materialise and a module resolve ON EVERY
// CALL, and `readPresence` calls it three times per standpoint. Under the
// party's load that was the largest removable share of a saturated event loop.
//
// ⚑ THE PROMISE IS CACHED, NOT THE MODULE, and that is what makes this a
// single-flight rather than only a cache. Twenty guests arriving together used
// to start twenty materialisations of the same tree; now the first one starts
// it and the other nineteen await the same promise. Caching the resolved module
// would have left that thundering herd exactly as it was, because the herd
// arrives before the first one finishes.
//
// KEYED BY THE REF, so a tick that moves main is a new key and the next read
// materialises the new tree. Nothing is pinned to a stale world; the key IS the
// freshness.
//
// A REJECTED IMPORT IS EVICTED. Caching a failure forever would turn one bad
// materialise into a permanently broken door, which is worse than the cost this
// memo exists to save.
// ⚑ THE WINDOW IS ON THE CALLER, NOT ON THE REF READING. The first version
// memoised `freshestMainRef` itself and broke its law: that reading answers "is
// origin ahead of local", and a five-second-old answer to that is not the law,
// which its own test proved by moving the ref and asking again in the same
// breath. So the ref reading stays exact and THIS is where the cadence changes
// — asked once per window per file instead of once per read. Same subprocess
// storm removed, nothing about the answer's meaning touched.
//
// PAST THE WINDOW THE REF IS RE-READ, and only a ref that actually MOVED costs
// a re-materialise: a window that expires over an unchanged ref just refreshes
// its timestamp and keeps the module. So the steady state is one git read per
// file per window, and a tick that moves main is picked up within one window

//
// NOTHING READS THE TABLE LIVE ANY MORE, which is what made the deletion a
// deletion rather than a port: `storedDepartures` moved to `acts` in POS-154,
// and `refreshEntities` and `crossing-save`'s `<N>.jsonl` half moved in
// POS-156's part 0. Every walk writes one act, awaited, through `appendJournal`
// -- `world.mjs § walkViaOffice` and `world-apex.mjs § spawnOnEnter`, which was
// a THIRD writer of this table that POS-156's own measurement had not listed.
//
// `readMovements` STAYS, below, and so does the table. It holds the frozen era
// and two historical readers still ask it for that history
