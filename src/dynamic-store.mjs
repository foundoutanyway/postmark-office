// dynamic-store.mjs — `dynamic.db`, the town's THIRD database: the live layer.
//
// office.db indexes the TOWN repo. world.db indexes the WORLD repo. Both are
// pure indexes — deleted and rebuilt whole on every hydration, holding nothing
// they cannot recompute. This one is different, and the difference is the whole
// point of Stage 2:
//
//   dynamic.db is STORE-CANON. It is writable between hydrations and it holds
//   state no repo currently holds — where a resident is standing, what they are
//   riding, what was said and is still hanging in the air.
//
// From the three state classes (LOGOS/state-and-time.md):
//
//   store-canon-durable  entity positions, attachments. Loss is bounded by the
//                        crossing-save: at most half a crossing of movement.
//   store-ephemeral      emission PRESENCE, under a TTL. Loss *is* fading — a
//                        restart is a thunderclap and the air clears. The
//                        OCCURRENCE survives, in the crossing log.
//
// So this file is not exempt from the covenant, it carries a narrower one:
//
//   EVERY ROW IS RE-DERIVABLE OR CROSSING-SAVE-RECOVERABLE. Entities re-derive
//   from the walk ledger (via world.db's events). Attachments recover from the
//   last STATE save plus the logs after it. Emissions do neither by design:
//   presence is allowed to be lost. (Retired on the record's flags, POS-269:
//   the file is the git-road drain's alone, and no door, save or panel opens it.)
//
// One consequence that shapes the code below: an emission row is NOT deleted
// when its TTL expires. Presence is a QUERY (`presentEmissions`), never a
// delete, because the occurrence has to survive long enough to reach a crossing
// log. `pruneEmissions` is gated on `meta.logged_through` — the instant up to
// which the crossing-save has crystallized occurrences into the world repo —
// so nothing is ever dropped before it is history.
//
// Env:
//   WORLD_EMISSIONS=1   world/say dual-writes an emission beside the voices log
//   WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2=1 Stage D: the movement record, after the ledger's freeze
//   WORLD_SINGLE_LOG=1  POS-5 slice 1: every world mutation enters the journal
//                       (one INSERT) instead of the per-write git checkout. OFF
//                       is byte-identical to the git lane — a falsifier, not a
//                       hope (test/world-journal.test.mjs § FLAG OFF).
