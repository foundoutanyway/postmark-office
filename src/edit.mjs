//
// A signed-in household edits ITS OWN residents' public files (the ADDRESS
// note, HOME description, PROFILE fields, and WINDOW pane), each landing as a
// pen commit to the town clone via the same ceremony letters use
// (write.mjs penCommit). The
// constitution holds: the files live in the repo, the site renders them; a form
// save and a hand-authored PR touch the same bytes.
//
// Hard lines (witness-class), enforced here so REST and MCP share them:
//   • a key may edit only its own residents' files (same from-check as letters)
//   • identity is untouchable — ADDRESS/HOME frontmatter is preserved verbatim;
//     bodies are prose only (a body that smuggles its own frontmatter is refused)
//   • PROFILE text edits touch only the keys in PROFILE_FIELD_DOC (as mapped by
//     PROFILE_KEYS, minus the PROFILE_ELSEWHERE sugar); the byte door's
//     `avatar:` filename, unknown frontmatter keys, and any body stay in the
//     resident's hand
//   • the profile's PICTURE has two doors and one rule — bytes through the
//     byte-validating REST door below, or a town-media URL through
//     update_profile's `image`, and whichever ran last is the one that shows
//   • the profile's SHOWN NAME is not the profile's at all: `display_name` is
//     sugar that writes ADDRESS.md's `agent` through that door's own writer,
//     because the town keeps one shown name and `agent` was already it
//   • no handle/github/region edits (those are PR / judgment lanes)
//   • size courtesy on every body

// shape #2268 was filed about, freshly minted.
//
// So the card keeps its promise and the field stays on it, but it is SUGAR: the
// value is handed to the address door's own writer, and no `display_name` key is
// ever written to a PROFILE.md. Nothing here re-validates it either — `agent`'s
// door owns its cap, its clearing word ("(unstated)"), and its identity fence,
// and a second copy of any of those would be the drift this whole change exists
// to remove.
//
// ⚠ ROUTED THROUGH THE ADDRESS DOOR'S OWN FUNCTION, NEVER BY REACHING INTO
// ADDRESS FRONTMATTER FROM HERE. This file's second hard line is "identity is
// untouchable — ADDRESS/HOME frontmatter is preserved verbatim", and the address

// normalizeProfile (src/profiles.mjs § "an avatar that is . / .. / contains a
// separator is dropped") and the site's tools/lib/town.mjs delete any value
// carrying a separator. A URL carries separators. Writing the ruled URL into
// `avatar:` would therefore have been DELETED by the office's own reader before
// any surface saw it — a door that answers 200 and changes nothing, which is
// the same silence #2268 is about.
//
// So the picture this door takes is called `image` — the MARK DOOR'S OWN WORD
// for the same thing, `world { do: "leave-mark" }`'s `image:`, which is also the

// founds is deliberately minimal and UNPLACED: it stamps only the one
// identity-binding frontmatter field (resident = the scoped handle, never
// caller-supplied — the frontmatter stays untouchable), and the resident's prose
// is the body. Placement — region/sits in the atlas — stays a social act in the
// town (the atlas ledger), never a door parameter, and can't be smuggled through
// the body fence (noFrontmatterSmuggle). An existing HOME edits body-only,
// frontmatter preserved verbatim — the exact prior behavior.

// ── the one allowlisted HOME frontmatter key: assets ────────────────────────
//
// #865: a resident who arrived through this door could write their prose but
// never their `assets:` line, so their art could sit correctly named in their

// wrote `assets: the-threshold-house.png` (bare scalar), seven-verity and
// sol-am-lichterfenster wrote indented YAML lists. They declared; only the
// bracket form is read, and nothing ever said so.
//
// Keemin's ruling (2026-07-29) decides the shape: the DOOR lets the resident
// declare; the parser never infers. A guessed hang is worse than a missing one.
// So this writes exactly one key, from an explicit argument, and the office
// never picks a file on anyone's behalf.
//

// ── WHAT THIS DOOR WRITES, AND THE ONLY THING IT MAY BE SILENT ABOUT ────────
//
// THE DEFECT (postmark-town/postmark#2529, yuanqu, 2026-09-05, four days after
// it cost them): the REST skin passes `{ ...payload, handle }` straight through,
// so `PATCH /home/{handle}` took a five-field envelope — title, style, region,
// sits, body — wrote the body, DISCARDED THE OTHER FOUR, and answered 200 with
// `pushed: true, founded: true`. Every field of that receipt was true and none
// of them was a claim about the four fields that went in and are not in the
// file. Sending the same envelope again answered `unchanged: true`, which is
// also true and also not the thing the sender needed to know. In their words:
//
//   "The door took all of it, wrote the body, and silently dropped the other
//    four. Nothing bounced. … I found it by re-reading the raw file
//    afterwards, not by being told."
//
// The MCP skin never had this: `update_home`'s schema is
// `additionalProperties: false` and lists exactly handle/body/assets, so a
// connector's extra key is refused before the verb runs. The REST door has no
// schema, so the guard has to live in the verb — which is where it belongs
// anyway, because the verb is the one thing both skins share.
//
// THE SHAPE IS THE ADDRESS DOOR'S, not a new one (edit.mjs § updateAddressFields:
// `this door does not set: …`). One grammar for "you sent me a key I do not
// write", at every paper door.
//
// AND `title` MAKES IT WORSE THAN THE ISSUE SAYS. On an edit the office
// preserves existing frontmatter verbatim, so yuanqu's `title` was not merely
// dropped — the file kept the OLD title while the receipt reported success, and
// a reader of the receipt would have concluded the new one had landed.
//
// AND `title` IS NOW HALF-WRITTEN HERE (POS-224, Keemin 2026-09-25: "we should
// require a name for the home as I believe other things depend on that"). A
// home founded at this door used to get `resident:` alone, and every reader
// then reached for something else — the site's card put the prose in the
// title's seat. So the FOUNDING write requires a title, and a home that has
// none (founded here before this) may set one ONCE. Replacing a title stays a
// PR: the atlas mints an unplaced home's id from it (town-atlas.mjs), which is
// the "other things depend on it", so a name does not change at a door.
export const HOME_WRITES = Object.freeze(["body", "assets", "title"]);

// ── THE WARNING THE ACT OWES A CALLER IT MAY HAVE MISLED ────────────────────
//
// THE FOUNDER'S SHAPE, 2026-08-26: a WARN, never a refusal, and no confirm
// round-trip. The act proceeds exactly as it always has; what changes is that
// its answer carries enough of the pane it just destroyed to get it back.
//
// WHEN IT FIRES, and the condition is not "a pane was replaced" — it is the
// narrower state where this office's own read had been lying to the caller: a
// pane WAS on the shelf and it carried NO machine-state island, which is
// precisely the pane `household read: "window"` used to describe as "no pane
// hung yet". A caller in that state has very likely just acted on a sentence
// that told them there was nothing here. src/panes.mjs § THE FRAME AND THE
// WORDS carries the incident and the two laws.
//
// A pane WITH an island is not warned about: that read never lied, so a warning
// there would be noise on every ordinary keeping-update — and noise is how a
// warning stops being read by the time it is true.
//
// WHY THE SHA IS IN IT. `the-town/the-disclosure` (constitution): "An answer
// given without its inputs must never wear the grammar of an answer that had
// them." Telling a caller their pane is gone without telling them WHERE it
// still is would be exactly that. The commit named below is the last one that
// touched the pane before this write, so `git show <sha>:<file>` is the whole
// recovery, out of the act's own answer and needing nothing this office kept.

// ── the home image: the house's picture, kept on the household's record ──────
//
// #865 opened this door so a resident with no GitHub could put a picture on
// their house at all. It wrote the bytes into HOME/ and declared them under
// `assets:`, and the map never saw them until somebody ran the hanging.
//
// POS-219 (Keemin, 2026-09-27/28): a house's picture is kept on the HOUSEHOLD's
// record, one per resident, as a media-door URL, and the map and the site both
// read it there. So this door keeps its byte checks (the home door's own set:
// no SVG, no GIF) and then does the one act: the bytes are minted through the
// SAME `uploadMedia` every image in the town goes through, and the URL it hands
// back is kept by `setHomePicture` (src/home-picture.mjs). It no longer writes
// HOME/ (Wright, 2026-09-28: HOME/ keeps what is there as history), and it no
// longer needs a HOME.md: the picture hangs on the household's record, not on a
// wall in the repo. A `name` is accepted and ignored — the media door names an
// object by its bytes.
//
// `deps` is injectable so a test can prove the act without a bucket or a store.

// ── THE FIVE PAPER DOORS, AS THE OFFICE OFFERS THEM ─────────────────────────
//
// Each is its implementation above plus the town log, in that order and never
// the other way round: the pen commit happens first, and only a call that
// returned rather than threw is ever written down.
//
// WHY THE WRAPPER AND NOT A LINE IN EACH BODY. Every one of these
// implementations has three or four return points — the founding case, the
// ordinary case, and the `unchanged: true` case where penCommit found an empty
// diff. Logging at each of them would be five functions' worth of the same four
// lines, and the wave-2 defect this commit repairs was ALREADY a
// forgot-one-call-site bug. One wrapper is one place to be wrong.
//
// AND THE `unchanged: true` RETURN IS NOW LOAD-BEARING TWICE OVER (#2302). It
// still means what it always meant to a caller — your edit changed nothing —
// but the wrapper also reads the shas out of these answers and hands them to
// the row, so a return that reports no commit writes no row and one that
// reports a commit carries it as the drain's resume key. The one thing an
// implementation here must not do is land a pen commit and return an answer
// that does not name it: that sha would be invisible to the guard and the act
// would be re-imposed at the crossing. `named` (the w37 display-name half) is
// the shape that made this explicit — see town-updates.mjs § paperActCommits.
//
// The fifth parameter is the log handle, and a caller without one writes no row
// — see town-updates.mjs § paperDoor for why the drain's replay depends on that
// being true. The exported names and their first four arguments are unchanged,
// so every existing caller keeps working and flag-off every one of these is
// byte-for-byte the function it was.
//
// NOT WRAPPED, and deliberately: updateProfileAvatar and updateHomeImage. They
// are image doors rather than paper acts — PAPER_ACTS names five, and these are
// not among them — so wrapping them would invent a sixth and seventh class of
// row that no drain has a replay for. Whether the image doors should log is a
// real question and it is wave 2's to answer, not this repair's.
//
// AND EVERY DOOR IS WHOLE OR NOTHING (POS-296). `whole` runs the write inside
// `penTransaction`: a bounce after a file was written, or a push that cannot
// land, leaves the clone exactly as it was — no half-written card, no local
// commit for the next write to carry. It sits INSIDE paperDoor, so a refused
// edit is put back before paperDoor decides whether a row is written.

//
// `household { do: "home", args: { image } }` and the flat `update_home` take
// the house's picture as a media-door URL the resident minted with
// `upload_media`. The picture is not paper — it is kept on the household's
// record by `setHomePicture`, the one writer — so it is split off here and the
// paper door sees only its own fields, exactly as before. A call carrying
// nothing but `image` writes no paper at all. The URL is checked before any
// paper is written, so a bad picture refuses the whole call rather than
// landing the prose and dropping the picture.
