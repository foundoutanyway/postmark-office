// enter-exit-ledger.mjs — THE ENTER/EXIT LEDGER, DERIVED. One pen, one question.
//
// ── WHAT WENT WRONG, AND IT WAS SILENT FOR TWO DAYS ─────────────────────────
//
// On 2026-08-24 at 19:39:13Z the enter/exit pair stopped spending a git commit
// per act. Under WORLD_SINGLE_LOG the act writes a journal row instead, and the
// row carries its formatted ledger lines verbatim under `payload.lines`. That
// half shipped and works: the record of every crossing since has been kept.
//
// Nothing ever gave those lines to a reader. Both occupancy readers — the
// office's own door and the viewer through it — read the ledger FILE, and the
// file stopped growing at that exact instant. Measured 2026-08-26 on prod:
// `/api/world/dynamic` answered `journal: 39, journal_drained_through: null`,
// so thirty-nine acts sat in the log undrained while the file, prod, and the
// office door all still served the same last line — sable entering
// fabel-of-garrison/the-riverside-arcade at 147.6377, two days stale.
//
// Every enter in between succeeded, was recorded, and showed NOWHERE. A door
// that takes an act, keeps it, and then shows the caller a world in which it
// never happened is worse than a door that refuses: a refusal can be read.
//
// The law this violates is the enter class's own, `the-town/enter` v4,
// constitution tier, quoted verbatim:
//
//     "An entry is one passage written — who crossed, into what, at a
//      threshold you truly stand before; exit writes the next, to the
//      effective parent."
//
// WRITTEN. A passage that is written and cannot be read back is not written.
//
// ── THE SHAPE OF THE FIX ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ledger stops being a file anybody appends to and becomes a DERIVED
// artifact, regenerated whole from its two sources every time it is asked for:
//
//   the frozen era   WORLD/enter-exit-ledger-frozen.md — every crossing made
//                    before the cutover, when each act took its own commit.
//                    Frozen with honor, exactly as the walk ledger was on
//                    2026-08-10 when movement moved into the store. Never
//                    appended to again, so it is a fixed input rather than an
//                    accumulating output.
//   the live era     the record's enter/exit acts, in the record's own order,
//                    carrying `payload.lines` verbatim — the exact text the
//                    acting pen formatted. It was the sqlite journal's rows
//                    until POS-194; it is `acts` now, read through the same
//                    row set and order `/world2/occupancy` folds. There is no
//                    sqlite left under this module.
//
//   derived = header + frozen lines + journal lines not already among them
//
// Full regeneration is the point, not append. It is the pattern the founder
// already ruled for `WORLD/containment.json`: thrown away and rebuilt at every
// fold, which is what keeps a derived thing from rotting the way a stored one
// does. It also BACKFILLS by construction — the first time this runs it emits
// every act since the cutover, because they were all still in the log.
//
// NO PEN AT ALL, since #2152 (2026-08-28). This module derives; nothing in this
// office writes the enter/exit files into the world clone any more.
//
// The paragraph above used to say ONE PEN, and it was wrong twice over. Two
// pens were writing: the crossing-save's emit (which ran twice a crossing) and
// `materializeLedgers` in world-drain.mjs (the older append-shaped answer, which
// the note here assumed was safely unwired). Both appended LIVE-ERA passages
// into a file the world repo's law says must equal the frozen era exactly —
// "the world repo has no journal to read — a longer derived file means a hand
// wrote in it" — which turned the world's grammar suite red during passage
// activity, cost the settlement sweep its ability to attribute a failure, and
// refused the whole crossing. Three hand-repairs on world main.
//
// The count that mattered was never one pen versus two. It was that the record
// has a DERIVER and therefore needs no pen: the committed copy is the frozen
// era, the live era is derived at read time, and a file written by anybody is a
// second answer to a question that already has one.
//
// ── THE GRACE WINDOW, AND WHY BOTH NAMES ────────────────────────────────────
//
// "threshold" is retired here: the word is doing four unrelated jobs in this
// town (the ferry's crossing, a water crossing, the inter-town `crossing`
// class, and this act), and `the-threshold` is separately the name of a
// boundary LAW that has nothing to do with walking through a door. The file,
// the door and the viewer's reader all take the enter/exit name.
//
// But the office, the world package and the site's viewer bundle deploy on
// three separate clocks, and a rename that orphans a name-keyed reader is the
// exact defect that had this town walking four times too slow for four days. So
// for a grace window the record answered to both names and the door answered
// under both.
//
// THE TWIN FILE IS GONE (2026-08-28, at the founder's word: "truly useless").
// `WORLD/threshold-ledger.md` is deleted from world main; one committed file
// remains. What survives here is only the READING half, and each piece has its
// own reason:
//
//   LEDGER_OLD in LEDGER_NAMES — journal rows written before the rename name
//     the old path in `payload.ledger`. Dropping it would drop their lines out
//     of the derivation, which is the rename-orphans-a-reader defect again.
//   LEDGER_OLD in `frozenLinesIn`'s fallback — for a clone that predates the
//     split. It cannot fire against a world checkout that has the frozen file.
//   `DEPRECATED_DOOR` and the `/world/threshold-ledger` route — the office's
//     API contract, still asked for by viewer bundles built before the rename.
//     It answers the same derived bytes and names its successor.
//
// None of those writes anything. The deleted file was the only half that could.

 * THE ONE I/O SEAM over the record, so the door and the save read the same rows
 * by the same route.
 *
 * ── IT READS `acts`, NOT THE JOURNAL (POS-194, G1 gate 1 of 3) ─────────────
 *
 * This was the LAST live-era reader of the sqlite journal's enter/exit rows, and
 * it is the reason G1 could not land: `src/world2-acts.mjs` said so in its own
 * words — "deleting this row's mirror today still costs the town its occupancy.
 * The row stays; POS-156 is where it goes." It has gone here. There is no
 * sqlite open left under this function and no flag over it; a switch would be
 * the office keeping two answers to one question.
 *
 * ⚑ THE ROW SET AND THE ORDER ARE THE OCCUPANCY DOOR'S OWN, imported from
 * `live-reads.mjs` rather than spelled again here. `/world2/occupancy` reads
 * `PASSAGE_ACTIONS` in `PASSAGE_ORDER_SQL` order, and two readers of one record
 * asking two different questions is how the town learns to trust neither.
 *
 * ⚑ THE FOUNDING ERA IS EXCLUDED — `payload->>'_ledger' IS NULL`, the clause
 * `storeDepartureRows` carries for the same reason. `PASSAGE_ACTIONS` matches
 * the 155 backfilled crossings of the frozen ledger too, and the frozen era
 * ALREADY reaches this derivation by another road: `frozenLinesIn` reads it out
 * of the clone's own file. Returning those rows here would hand `deriveEnter-
 * ExitLedger` the founding era twice — and the de-dupe could not save it,
 * because the live set wins its POSITION, so 155 crossings would silently
 * migrate out of their place in the archive and into the live era's tail.
 *
 * ⚑ ONE SERIALIZER, AND IT IS `journalLinesIn`. The lines are carried VERBATIM
 * in `payload.lines`, exactly as the pen formatted them, and both pens put that
 * payload in `acts` unchanged (`insertAct`, `mirrorAct`). So the port moves the
 * row SOURCE and nothing else: the text below this line is derived by the same
 * function, from the same field, as it was on the journal.
 *
 * ⚑ WHY NOT `passageRecords`, WHICH IS THE FOLD ITSELF — measured, and it is a
 * STOP rather than a preference. `passageOf` reads `lines[0]`, ONE line per
 * act; a chained enter writes one act carrying one line per mark crossed
 * (`world-verbs.mjs § enter` pushes a `formatEnterExit` per link) and this
 * suite pins that all of them reach the served record. The fold also REFUSES a
 * line that does not match its vendored grammar, where this record's law is the
 * opposite — "a line this does not understand must survive into the derived
 * file so that parser can say so out loud". The fold is right for occupancy and
 * wrong for the archive, and asking it for the archive would lose lines nobody
 * would ever look for.
 *
 * Feature-detected and fail-soft, both deliberately, and unchanged by the port.
 * An office pointed at no record must still serve the frozen era rather than
 * 500, and `actsQuery` answers `null` for exactly that — "not asked" against
 * "asked, and the answer is none".
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NAMED, NEVER FILLED — and this is the one place in this module
 * where getting that wrong would rebuild the very bug it exists to remove. An
 * unreachable record and an empty one produce the SAME derived text: the record
 * as of the cutover. One of those is the truth and the other is a two-day-stale
 * fossil served as though it were current, which is exactly what prod did from
 * 2026-08-24 to 2026-08-26 with nothing anywhere saying so.
 *
 * So a failure comes back as a SENTENCE beside the rows rather than as an empty
 * array. The caller still gets a usable answer; it simply cannot mistake "nobody
 * has crossed a door since the cutover" for "I could not read the log".
 *
 * (Caught by running this against a copy of prod's own store, 2026-08-26: a
 * mis-resolved path made the read throw, and the draft answered 155 acts with a
 * straight face.)
 *
 * ⚑ RENAMED from `liveJournalRows`, which named a source it no longer has. No
 * caller outside this module and its suite ever held the old name.
