// fault-words.mjs — THE OFFICE'S OWN WORDS FOR ITS OWN FAULT, at every door.
//
// POS-568 (office #483) gave the REST doors one rule: when the office trips,
// the resident reads the door's own sentence ("the drafts door tripped") and one
// fixed hint, and what failed (the raw error, a SQL fragment, a path on the box,
// pg's own hint, a child's stderr) goes to the office's log. Those words lived
// in server.mjs, which nothing else can import (it imports everything). The MCP
// door (POS-573) and the modules that build their own 5xx bounces (POS-578) say
// the same words, so the words moved here: a leaf, importing only store-pool's
// classifier, with one owner. server.mjs imports them back unchanged.

// says a count "could not be read — unknown, not zero" keeps that promise, and
// its parenthetical is one of these fixed reasons, never the error's own text.
// The raw error goes to the office's log. Map a site by what it was reading:
//   record  the office's store (the acts, the docket, the registry, a projection)
//   files   the world's files (the world clone, git, the engine at a ref)
//   parse   a saved file that does not parse (a file read whose JSON is bad)
//   chain   the Base chain (its RPCs)

 *   1. pg's SQLSTATE (five characters, never a Node errno), or a lost store: record
 *   2. a child's stderr (git), or a Node errno (ENOENT, EPERM, EBUSY…): files
 *   3. a parser's error, or JSON named as a word, never as ".json": parse
 *   4. only then the text: a refused or lost store, pg's words: record; git's: files
 * Anything else is null, and the site's kind stands.
