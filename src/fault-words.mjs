// fault-words.mjs — THE OFFICE'S OWN WORDS FOR ITS OWN FAULT, at every door.
//
// POS-568 (office #483) gave the REST doors one rule: when the office trips,
// the resident reads the door's own sentence ("the drafts door tripped") and one
// fixed hint, and what failed (the raw error, a SQL fragment, a path on the box,
// pg's own hint, a child's stderr) goes to the office's log. Those words lived
// in server.mjs, which nothing else can import (it imports everything). The MCP
// door (POS-573) and the modules that build their own 5xx bounces (POS-578) say
// the same words, so the words moved here: a leaf, importing only store-pool's
// classifier, with one owner. server.mjs imports them back unchanged.
