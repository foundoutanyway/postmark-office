// fund.mjs — the /fund door: a patron's tx hash becomes a witnessed pot receipt,
// or a refusal they are owed verbatim.
//
// This is S3's founder-manual seam with the hand-carrying taken out of the
// middle and NOTHING ELSE loosened. The witness is still a real on-chain fact
// (usdc-witness.mjs, ported check-for-check from the operator's CLI); the ledger
// is still the only place a receipt exists; the pen is still the office's.
// What changes is who runs it: the patron, once, at the moment they have the
// hash in hand — instead of a letter, a queue, and an operator's evening.
//
// THE ORDER OF THE GUARDS IS THE LAW, and it is deliberately front-loaded so a
// patron learns the answer before the chain is even consulted:
//
//   1. shape        — is this a tx hash, a pot name, a handle at all
//   2. the pot      — does the town post this need? (`treasury` is refused here:
//                     it takes direct-to-town receipts, never a fund page)
//   3. the resident — holo only ever mints to a town household (§ 8); an
//                     outsider's dollars are still recorded, but by the
//                     operator's hand, not at this door
//   4. the witness  — the four on-chain checks, and the confession of what they
//                     cannot see
//   5. whole dollars — see THE CENTS below
//   6. the ref      — "one dollar, one mint chance": already recorded, bounce
//   7. D5 headroom  — "intake refuses dollars past a pot's posted target,
//                     mechanically (recording tool / door bounce), except pots
//                     explicitly marked uncapped"
//   8. record       — the town's OWN epoch-close --receipt, under the flock
//
// Guards 6 and 7 are BOTH pre-checks AND enforced behind us: the town's
// `epoch-close.mjs --receipt` refuses a duplicate ref and refuses past-target
// dollars on its own, and stamp-verify refuses a duplicate ref that reached the
// ledger by any route at all. This door's copies exist to give the patron a
// clean sentence instead of a subprocess's FATAL — never to be the only guard.
// That is why they are checked with the town's own `intakeCheck` and the town's
// own `foldPotReceipts`, injected from the clone: one copy of the law.
//
// THE CENTS (a v0 decision, flagged for Keemin — NOT a ruling).
// The ledger's receipt grammar takes WHOLE dollars: `usd: [1-9]\d*`. USDC does
// not — the proven test payment was $83.93. Three answers were possible and two
// are worse than this one: refusing the row leaves a patron's irreversible
// on-chain money unrecorded, and widening the grammar to cents is a ledger-law
// change no build lane may make. So the receipt records floor(usd), the
// remainder is disclosed in the answer and on the page as money the town holds
// that priced nothing, and a payment under $1 is refused before it is sent
// rather than swallowed. This is the same shape as R1's "the seam keeps the
// change" — but R1 rules stamps, not dollars, so this leans on it by analogy
// and wants the founder's word before it is called law.

  //
  //   A claim naming pot P verifies against P's own mapped address AND against
  //   the standing shared intake, because the shared address was the published
  //   answer for every pot up to the moment P's own address was minted.
  //   Refusing a tx that paid the shared address would strand an honest payer
  //   who followed yesterday's instructions, and yesterday's instructions were
  //   the town's own.
  //
  // So a shared-address payment (`to_pot === null`) passes for ANY pot, exactly
  // as it did before per-pot addresses existed, and will keep passing for as
  // long as any surface still shows the shared address — which is precisely
  // what deploy/intake-addresses.json's `_never` keeps true by refusing to map
  // it: "Do NOT map the shared intake address to a pot to make the queue go
  // away. That would make the office decide where a stranger's money went,
  // which is the one judgement this whole lane refuses to make."
  //
  // The union is NOT symmetric. Paying P's address while claiming Q is not
  // grandfathered: no published instruction ever pointed a Q-payer at P's
  // address, so the mismatch is a real disagreement and is bounced by name
  // rather than resolved in favour of either side. The claim is not silently
