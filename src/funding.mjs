// funding.mjs — the office's read-side fold over the funding seam's ledger rows.
//
// PINNED to the grammar the town lane landed (tools/stamp-mint.mjs § THE
// FUNDING SEAM, branch seam/ledger-legs-aligned @ 3668881b — re-pinned when the
// σ leg became R12's source-tagged mint). Every pattern below was diffed
// mechanically against that tip, not eyeballed: POT_ID_CLASS and EPOCH_CLASS are
// byte-identical to the town's, and so is every row kind below. The six row
// kinds, exactly as the town writes them:
//
//   - <date> · pot-receipt · pot:<pot> · rail: <stripe|usdc|paypal|grant> · usd: <n> · from: <payer> · ref: <ref>
//   - <date> · <handle> → stake:pot/<pot> · <n> · via: <api|mail:letter-id>
//   - <date> · stake:pot/<pot> → <handle> · <n> · for: pot-return:<epoch>
//   - <date> · stake:pot/<pot> → <handle> · <n> · for: unstake · via: <founder|api|web>   (a stake taken back BEFORE the close — the founder's word 2026-09-17; not a close, so it never marks an epoch closed)
//   - <date> · stake:pot/<pot> → BURN · <n> · for: keeping:<epoch> · staker: <handle>
//   - <date> · minted · <staker> · <n> · for: keeping:<pot> · epoch:<epoch>
//   - <date> · holo · <payer> · <n> · pot:<pot> · epoch:<epoch> · ref: <ref>
//
// THE FOUNDER'S RULING, 2026-08-26. A seventh row kind was proposed on
// 2026-08-24 to carry a record of dollars alongside holo. It was IDEATION and it
// NEVER SHIPPED: no such row was ever minted, the sealed ledger holds none, and
// the founder ruled that holo stays and there is no replacement noun. So there
// is no second money row and no second register. `pot-receipt` is the ONLY money
// row in this grammar; the record-of-dollars idea survives here as plain prose
// and as a JOIN, never as a name.
//
// WHAT THAT MOVES, and it is the whole of the change: the proposed row used to
// be the only marker that a receipt's ref had been consumed by a close. That
// marker now lives on the HOLO ROW, which the close emits ONCE PER RECEIPT,
// ALWAYS — and its count MAY BE 0. So the holo count is `(\d+)`, not
// `([1-9]\d*)`: a grant, a treasury dollar, an outside payer, a ρ-capped
// household and a sole staker all mint nothing, and every one of them still
// gets its row. Without that, a zero-holo receipt would carry no mark of having
// been settled and every future close would count and mint against it again.
// Widening a count from "positive" to "non-negative" only ever ACCEPTS more, so
// no row that parsed before stops parsing: the widening is replay-safe.
//
// ATTRIBUTION LIVES ON THE RECEIPT. Who paid is the receipt's `from:`, how many
// dollars is its `usd:`, when is its date; a holo row names the receipt it
// settles in `ref:`. Nothing is duplicated and nothing is lost — join holo→
// receipt on `ref` and (payer, dollars, date, receipt, holo) all come back.
// `foldFunding` does exactly that join and returns it as `rollByParty` /
// `rollByPot`.
//
// The regexes below are copied byte-for-byte from that file, and the records
// this module returns carry the town's OWN kind strings and field names
// ('pot-stake', 'keeping-burn', 'holo', … / handle, pot, n, epoch, ref). That
// is deliberate: when the seam reaches the town's main and the office can
// import tools/stamp-mint.mjs live (the stamps precedent — one source of truth
// for the rule), hydrate swaps the import and nothing downstream moves.
//
// Two shapes to hold on to, because guessing them wrong is how a reader lies:
//   - `pot:` and `epoch:` are TIGHT (no space after the colon); `rail: `,
//     `usd: `, `from: `, `ref: `, `staker: `, `via: ` and `for: ` are LOOSE. A
//     tolerant field reader that demands a space drops the pot off every
//     receipt and every holo row in the ledger.
//   - the holo row and the pot-receipt are both ARROW-FREE. For holo that is
//     still the enforcement and not a formatting choice, though the reason
//     changed on 2026-09-17: not "holo has no verbs" (soulbound, repealed — a
//     holo STAMP spends like any other) but that the ROW is a mint and not a
//     movement. Wearing the movement shape would have the balance/mint folds
//     read it as a transfer AND the by-kind credit mint it, paying twice. A
//     movement-shaped holo row is not holo, and this module says so.
//
// Dollars are whole: `usd` is [1-9]\d* in the landed grammar. $10.50 is not a
// smaller payment, it is not a row.
//
// THE σ LEG IS MINT, SOURCE-TAGGED (R12, Keemin 2026-08-21 afternoon; pinned at
// seam/ledger-legs-aligned 3668881b): "the σ leg IS ORDINARY MINT, source-tagged
// (`minted · for: keeping:<pot>`), with NO liquid coin (the coin was paid when
// the stake burned; the row stays purpose-tagged so balance folds never hand
// liquid back). It COUNTS toward the ρ base ... It stays EXCLUDED from the
// genesis parity formula." The noun "keeping-equity" is retired from every
// resident-facing surface; the vocabulary is "minted · for keeping".
//
// THREE SHAPES ARE RETIRED, and this module keeps CLAIMING all three so an old
// row surfaces as invalid under its own name instead of falling silently through
// a reader that no longer recognizes it — being told "this shape was retired" is
// a different thing from being told nothing:
//   - `MINT → <handle> · <n> · for: keeper-equity:<pot>/<epoch>` — the first
//     draft's row, paid to the pot's BENEFICIARY as spendable primary mint.
//   - `· keeping-equity · <staker> · …` — the second draft's row: right
//     recipient, right non-liquidity, retired noun.
//   - `MINT → <staker> · <n> · for: keeping:<pot>` — the smuggle: R12's own
//     source tag wearing a movement arrow. The town returns 'unknown' for all
//     three and the verifier fails the walk on each.
//
// The live row is ARROW-FREE, and that is R12's "no liquid coin" rendered as
// shape: the town's foldBalances and foldMintCount key on the movement shape, so
// neither can see this row, and the readers that should count it opt in by name.
//
// D1 (same day): "ownership is a derived READ = minted (all sources) + holo —
// NOT a tense; no fifth tense node." So the door does not invent a fifth tense
// and does not quietly widen `minted`: it returns an `ownership` block that does
// the summing in the open.
//
// ⚠ `tenses.minted` NO LONGER STAYS THE EARNED PRIMARY NUMBER, and this note
// said it did until 2026-09-17. It is the town's `foldMintCount`, which gains a
// holo arm at the founder's ruling (postmark-town/postmark#2886), so it is
// primary mint PLUS holo. The invariant the old sentence was protecting —
// `liquid = mint_count − staked` — SURVIVES, and it survives for a specific
// reason worth writing down: a holo row credits BOTH sides, the mint count and
// the balance, so widening `minted` by `n` widens `liquid` by the same `n` and
// the subtraction still closes. That is exactly what made the keeping leg
// different: it is mint with NO liquid coin, so folding IT in would widen one
// side only and break the invariant while looking plausible. Holo is a whole
// stamp; the keeping leg is a record. Hence holo is inside `minted` and the
// keeping leg is still named beside it.
//
// SOULBOUND IS REPEALED — THE FOUNDER'S RULING, 2026-09-17, verbatim: "non-
// spendable is repealed; the stamps are like any other, but are holo to signify
// the special source." And, on the cap: "I'm good to let funding minted stamps
// contribute to the max stamps you can get from another fund. it compounds by
// design."
//
// So the sentence this block carried until today — holo is SOULBOUND, never
// spendable, never stakeable, never a balance — is GONE, not softened. Holo is
// fresh mint to a giver, liquid like any stamp; the word names its source and
// its ink. A holo row of `n` is `n` stamps in the payer's balance and in
// minted-cumulative, it stakes and votes and pays and transfers like any stamp,
// and it counts inside the ρ base at the next close.
//
// THE LAW THIS MODULE MUST NEVER BREAK IS NOW THE OTHER ONE, AND IT IS THE
// REASON THIS FILE GAINS NO ARITHMETIC TODAY: this module does not hold a
// balance and never has. Every stamp number the office serves is the TOWN's own
// fold, imported live from the checkout —
//
//   - the `stamps` table (balance/mint_count/staked) is derived by
//     src/town-index.mjs § stampFold from the town's foldBalances /
//     foldMintCount / foldStaked, and src/town-index-store.mjs § stampsDetail
//     reads that table;
//   - both stake clips take their balance from the town's ballotState —
//     src/pot-stake-exec.mjs § clipPotStake and src/stake-exec.mjs via
//     tools/ballot.mjs § clipApply.
//
// `foldFunding` below folds holo as a READOUT — who gave, to which pot, against
// which receipt — and a readout is all it may ever be. Crediting holo to a
// balance HERE would credit it TWICE, because the town's fold already did it
// upstream. The office's numbers therefore change BY DERIVATION at the next
// rehydrate once the town's folds gain their holo arm (postmark-town/postmark
// #2811); what changes in this repo is the words, and one double-count the old
// law had made harmless (src/queries.mjs § ownership).
//
// The arrow-free row shape STAYS, and its reason is now the surviving half of
// the old one: a holo row is a MINT, not a movement. `diagnose` still refuses a
// movement-shaped holo row, under that reason rather than under soulbound.
//
// Malformed rows are SURFACED, never silently rendered or silently dropped: a
// line that claims a funding kind but fails its field law lands in `invalid`
// with a named reason (the-town/the-disclosure — refuse or disclose, never
// quietly substitute). What this module can refuse is what ONE row proves
// wrong about itself: its shape, and the two reserved-pot rules that need no
// other line to see. Whole-ledger law — ref uniqueness, escrow ownership, the
// close-block replay, the meep law, the ρ-cap — is tools/stamp-verify.mjs's,
// and the door points at it rather than half-keeping it.

// This reader used to refuse every targetless pot, quoting a law that has since
// been amended. pot-keeping-ec2.json § _target now reads, verbatim:
//
//   "target_usd_per_epoch is the posted need, and it is the ONLY thing dollars
//    are priced against — the funded fraction is min(1, non-treasury dollars /
//    target). A pot with no target cannot close — UNLESS ITS OWN CLOSE WORD
//    SAYS ELASTIC (the DARKO ruling, 2026-08-23): then the need is whatever
//    arrived, floored by its min_close_usd."
//
// And pot-darko-fund.json § _close spells what elastic does:
//
//   "a month's close runs only if the accumulated roll — carried dollars plus
//    this month's — totals at least min_close_usd; otherwise dollars and stakes
//    both stand and ride to the next month … Nothing is ever refused at intake."
//
// So a targetless pot is lawful when it says why, and the reader's job is to
// carry the word rather than to refuse the pot. Until this changed, the MCP
// literally dropped the DARKO box: the town posted a need, and every door
// answered as though it did not exist.
//
// `none` is the other lawful word — the standing box that never closes. A pot
// with NO target and NO close word is still refused, and that refusal is the
// original law doing its remaining job: nothing in the record says how it could
// ever close, so nothing should quote it a funded fraction.
//
// `epoch` is the third, added 2026-08-25 when the keeping pot's record finally
// SPOKE the word it had always ruled in prose (pot-keeping-ec2.json § _close:
// "the word made explicit 2026-08-25 at the founder's word, and it rules
// NOTHING NEW"). This set is an ALLOWLIST — a word it does not hold is dropped
// to null, which reads downstream as "the record has not said". So leaving
