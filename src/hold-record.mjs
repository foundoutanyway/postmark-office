// hold-record.mjs — THE HOLD LANE'S RECORD, KEPT AND MOVED BY ITS DELTA
// (LOGOS v2, lane O2; review-610 S5, F1 and round 3).
//
// "Snapshot per settlement, compute only the delta" (POS-277's rule). A bare
// read asks who holds what — the units fold, the hold rows, where set-down
// things stand — and used to re-read and re-fold the hold lane's whole history
// each time. Here that history is folded into a BASE once per settlement, and
// each change after it is applied as a delta:
//
//   · ONE FULL READ PER SETTLEMENT. The base is re-built from the whole record
//     the first time a read lands in a new settlement window (`readEpoch`, the
//     crossing the office already counts by). Whatever any delta below could
//     ever miss is therefore missed for one settlement at most.
//   · the base is every act at or below `cutoff`, folded (counts are additive)
//     and compacted (attachments last-row-wins per thing, set-downs the latest
//     drop per thing);
//   · the WINDOW is every act above `cutoff`, re-read whole on each change, so
//     an act whose id was assigned before a neighbour's but committed after it
//     (acts.id is taken at INSERT, not at COMMIT) is still picked up the next
//     time the window is read;
//   · when the window grows past twice its width, its older half moves into the
//     base and `cutoff` advances. The width is in acts.id, and acts.id is the
//     WHOLE record's (every say and walk takes one), not the hold lane's: an act
//     still open when the cutoff passes it would be missed by the deltas — and is
//     picked up at the next settlement's full read (above). That is the bound.
//
// A change is applied whole or not at all: the kept record, and the top it
// answers for, move only after the new record composed (a failed read leaves
// the last good record standing, and the next read tries again). One rebuild at
// a time (single-flight): reads that arrive while a change is being applied
// share it. No table and no DDL: the base lives in the process, and a restart
// folds it once again. Every reader is injected, so the keeping itself is
// falsifiable without a store.
//
// ORDER. The readers return rows in their own ORDER BY — attachments by
// (born_at, era, id), holding rows by (acts.at, acts.id). The base/window split
// is by id (the only bound a delta read can push), so a row whose clock runs
// earlier than a base row's can sit above the cutoff. Attachments are merged
// back into the readers' order (`attachmentOrder`, born_at first) before
// last-row-wins, so such a row never outranks a later one. The units fold is
// additive and its order matters only to a refused move's anomaly note; a
// holding row (holdingRowOf) carries no time, so it is applied base-then-window.
