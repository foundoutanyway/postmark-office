// holding-law.mjs — WHO MAY MAKE, AND WHAT HOLDS: four properties read from the
// class tree (LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O1).
//
// The law (world #229 + #230, LOGOS/classes.md):
//
//   makers   "Who may make an instance is the class's `makers` property … a
//            constitution true/false, inherited down `extends`. The root,
//            `postmark-node`, answers false … It replaces the hand-kept
//            `RESIDENT_INSTANTIABLE` whitelist." (ruled 16:02, shaped 18:44)
//   holder   "A holder is anything with `holder: true` … a true/false property
//            with two child properties: `capacity`, how many it can hold, and
//            `open`, whether other households may give and take." (16:03–16:05)
//   resident "`holder: true` and `capacity: 24`, both constitution and locked."
//   thing    "`holder` is sovereign, default false … When it is true, `capacity`
//            (sovereign, default 30, constitution children min 1 / max 120) and
//            `open` (sovereign, default true) apply."
//
// So a class answers through its lineage (world-classes § classProperty, nearest
// first), and an instance may say its own value only where the property's tier
// is `sovereign`: "The constitution properties are the town's, and no instance
// writes them" (classes.md § What an instance writes). Nothing here is a copy of
// a number. A property no class in the lineage states answers its ruled
// default only where the law names one here (the root's `makers: false`).

/** A record's true/false, in either spelling a frontmatter parser leaves it. */

  return typeof n === "number" && Number.isInteger(n) ? n : null;
};

/**
 * May a resident make an instance of this class? `classProperty` is the
 * class layer's reader (world-classes § classProperty). An unread `makers`

/**
 * What a mark (or a class, given `mark: null`) holds by law: `{ holder,
 * capacity, min, max, open, from }`. The instance's own field counts only
 * where the property's tier is sovereign. `legacy` is the caller's older
 * spelling of the same numbers (the chest dials, the thing class's
 * carry_cap), read SECOND, after every property in the lineage: G4, settled
 * 2026-10-17, property first and dial second.
