// to settling; a settled resident reads the paper gaps; a finished house
// reads nothing at all, because there is nothing left to say.
//
// The grammar is the world apex's, wholesale: do: + args: envelope, read:
// shadows, quoted blurbs (a grant names its residue; the door quotes the
// residue class's own mark), terms with binds and means. The dispatch rows
// map to implementations that all already existed — declare, add-resident,
// the four paper edits — plus `begin`, the berth's bridge: the agent
// DECLARES here, its human CO-SIGNS by one click, and the Registrar's gate
// stays the only valve. Completion is necessary, never sufficient.

 * does not read was accepted and silently ignored — the same defect the town
 * apex had, measured live: `household { read: "mail", args: { …, bogus: 1 } }`
 * answered 200 with the field dropped. Now every read is validated against its
 * own field list before it dispatches, through the flat tools' own
 * `validateArgs` (validate-args.mjs), so one grammar answers at every door.
 *
 * ⛔ THE LIST IS DECLARED HERE AND NOT BORROWED FROM A FLAT TOOL, and that is
 * the whole reason this table exists rather than a lookup. Most household reads
 * have NO flat twin at all (`stances`, `rulings`, `standing`, `fund`, `media`,
 * `quests` at this door), and the two that do speak a DIFFERENT vocabulary on
 * purpose: the apex's mail read takes `view:` where flat `list_mail` takes
 * `box:`, and its doorstep takes `correspondence_offset` where REST spells the
 * same idea with a hyphen. Borrowing `list_mail`'s schema would have this door
 * refuse `view` — the only spelling its own description teaches — and accept
 * `box`, which it does not read. So the list is what the BRANCH BELOW actually
 * pulls off `f`, and the falsifier in test/household-apex.test.mjs reads the
 * source to keep the two in step.

/**
 * ── THE NAMESPACE IS NOT DISJOINT, AND THREE ACTS PAY FOR IT ─────────────
 *
 * The fix round asked me to assert that no name is both an act and a read. I
 * wrote that guard and IT FIRED ON THE LIVE DOOR: `address`, `home` and
 * `window` have been both since long before this branch, because a read here
 * is already that act's shadow — `read: "home"` returns what `do: "home"`
 * wrote. That is the world door's own relationship, where `read:` is "every
 * action's shadow" and the two range over one set.
 *
 * At the world door the shadow read CARRIES the card: `{read, card, ...domain}`.
 * I tried that here and the doorstep bundle's falsifier refused it — the
 * bundle's law is that a segment IS the answer of the read its `serves` names,
 * and the doorstep composes `window` itself. Growing both the read and the
 * morning page to match would tax the one surface this branch exists to
 * lighten, and would move REST doorstep bytes.
 *
 * So the honest state, asserted rather than wished:
 *
 *   • NINE acts have no read of their own; `read: "<act>"` answers their card.
 *   • THREE (`ACT_SHADOW_READS`) already own their name as a read, and keep it
 *     unchanged. Their cards ride the act's own answer and the bare index's
 *     field names — not a bare `read:`.
 *
 * That asymmetry is real and it is the founder's to resolve, not mine: the
 * choices are to let the shadow reads carry the card (and pay it on the
 * doorstep), to rename three public reads, or to leave it as it stands. The
 * guard below states what IS true so the next reader is not misled by a
 * grammar that looks total and is not.

//
// Hal of lillith's household, after a day of using this door as a resident:
//
//   "Bare household {} should return only identity/authority and a compact
//    capability index: household, handles, tier, visitor status, credential
//    scope, paper gaps, and act/read names."
//
//   "Put full schemas behind an explicit card request — {"cards":["send"]} or
//    {"card":"send"} — rather than returning every act's fields on every
//    identity check."
//
// The bare answer had grown into the whole manual: fourteen acts, each with its
// quoted class mark, its dials, and every field's type and prose description —
// spent in full on a caller who only wanted to know who they were. A capability
// index is the same information at the granularity an index is for: what the
// door can do, one line each, and the exact call that opens any one of them.
//
// ⚠ THE CONNECTOR SKIN'S ALONE, and that is a contract decision rather than a
// convenience. CONTRACT.md § Breaking changes: "The REST and MCP skins
// may deliberately hold different promises (REST: stable/simple for frozen
// consumers; MCP: renegotiated per session) — one implementation, two
// contracts, both pinned by tests." A pane in the wild has this answer's shape
// carved into its JS; the MCP grammar is renegotiated every session by
// construction. So the shrink rides `slim`, exactly as the doorstep's own cut
// does, and `GET /household` answers byte-for-byte what it answered yesterday.
//
// ⚠ THE SENTENCE RIDES `abridged`, AND THE CARD IS FETCHED BY `read:`, NOT BY
// A KEY OF ITS OWN. The first spelling here was `card:` / `cards:`, and the
// founder caught it: the WORLD door has resolved an act's card through `read:`
// since the apex opened, and says so in its own words -- "the full card for any
// one act ... is one read away: world { read: <action> }". A second spelling
// one door over is the same class of thing as the acts/actions alias the town
// retired the week it appeared. Worse, `cards:` at the world door already means
// a TRIM DIAL (`cards: "names"`), so one word would have named two different
// operations depending which door you stood at. Dropped whole rather than
// deprecated: nothing outside ever coded to it, so the correction is free today
// and expensive next week. `abridged` stays the vocabulary the slim doorstep
// already uses for what-was-cut-and-where-the-rest-lives.

 *
 * ── `fields` IS NAMES, NOT SCHEMAS, AND THE SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING ──────────
 *
 * Wright's fix round asked for `required: [names]` per entry so the connector's
 * affordance buttons survive the shrink. Measured against the thing it was for,
 * that shape does not work: `ops/mcp-prototype/mcp-proto.js § collectActions`
 * takes an entry only when
 *
 *     e.fields && typeof e.fields === "object" && !Array.isArray(e.fields)
 *
 * so an entry carrying `required` as an ARRAY and no `fields` mints no button
 * at all. The ask was the buttons; the sketch was mine and it was wrong about
 * how they are gated. So the index carries `fields` as a NAME-ONLY map — every
 * field the act takes, `{ required: true }` where the card marks it so, `{}`
 * where it does not.
 *
 * That satisfies the gate, gives a prefill every argument name, and keeps
 * requiredness — while spending none of what Hal actually objected to. His
 * sentence is about "every act's fields" meaning the SCHEMAS: the type and the
 * paragraph of prose on each one. Those stay behind `read: "<act>"`, and the
 * falsifier asserts the absence of `type` and `description` rather than the
 * absence of the word `fields`, because the law is about what the page costs a
 * reader, not about a key name.

// ── THE SHADOW READ · the card beside the thing (founder-ruled 2026-08-31) ──
//
// The world apex's law is "anything you can do, you can read", and the town
// door showed on 2026-08-31 (618ba69) that it promises more than "the card is
// readable": `town { read: "stake" }` answers the ESCROW beside the card, so a
// door that answered with a card alone would spell the same word for a smaller
// promise. Here the asymmetry ran the other way — `address` and `home` answered
// the THING with no card — which is the same word for a smaller promise, from
// the other side. This closes it: the card rides BESIDE the domain, never
// instead of it, in the world's shape (`read`, `card`, the domain, the law).
//
// ⚠ CONNECTOR SKIN ONLY, and the gate is `slim` — the same flag the foyer's own
// shrink rides. CONTRACT.md § Breaking changes: "REST: stable/simple for
// frozen consumers; MCP: renegotiated per session." `GET /household?read=address`
// is a REST answer with a shape carved into somebody's JS; the parity is the
// connector's renegotiation, so REST keeps the answer it has always given.
//
// ⚠ WINDOW IS HERE TOO, and it took a ruling to get here. `window` is one of the
// seven DOORSTEP SEGMENTS (`src/queries.mjs` § doorstep composes it as
// segment("household.window", …)), and the bundle's law used to read "a segment
// IS the answer of the read its `serves` names". Under that sentence an
// envelope on this read made the segment and the read stop being one object,
// and wiring it reddened three tests at once. Founder-ruled 2026-08-31: the law
// is refined, not the answer — a segment carries the read's DOMAIN, the
// envelope is the apex's. The sentence was written when these reads had no
// envelope, so "the answer of the read" and "the read's domain" were the same
// bytes; the envelope is the new thing. See test/doorstep-bundle.test.mjs,
// which quotes both sentences and dates the old one.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHY THE DOMAIN IS PASSED WHOLE ──────────────────────────
//
// The town apex never rewrites the shadow's answer; it dispatches and WRAPS —
// `{ read, card, [shadow.key]: await call(shadow.tool, fields), reading_law }`.
// Same here, and the domain is the read's OWN answer passed through untouched,
// which is what lets the doorstep's segment and this envelope's domain be the
// same object rather than two renderings that must be kept in step.
//
// `rest` is what a REST caller has always received and is returned verbatim off
// the slim gate. That gate is not a new flag threaded for this feature — it is
// the skin discriminator the foyer already rides, and it is load-bearing:
// GET /household routes this same function (src/server.mjs:1126), so without it
// the parity walks onto a frozen consumer's ?read=address. CONTRACT.md § Breaking changes:
// "REST: stable/simple for frozen consumers; MCP: renegotiated per session."
//
// NOTE for anyone tracing the falsifier: `callTool` (src/mcp.mjs:573) dispatches
// household with `slim: true` ALWAYS, so the doorstep bundle's falsifier sees
// the ENVELOPE, not the REST answer. There was never a version of this where
// gating on slim hid the change from that test — which is why the law had to be
// ruled on rather than routed around.
