// household-deriver.mjs — ONE DERIVER ANSWERS "WHICH HOUSE" (POS-160).
//
// The key is the household's SLUG, minted once (POS-158). From the w40 ship
// every NEW line that names a house names `hh:<slug>`; earlier lines keep their
// spellings, because history is not rewritten. `formerly` is the one alias
// mechanism, and THIS FILE is the one place it is read.
//
// ── WHY ONE, AND WHY HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three implementations answered "which house" before this file existed, each
// with its own idea of what an answer is:
//
//   the STORE's    `world2-claims.mjs § householdKeyFor` — a lookup in
//                  `identities`, whose `household` column is a projection of
//                  the WORLD repo's copy of the town's pins. Four hops from
//                  the fact, and it answered in whatever spelling that copy
//                  happened to carry (measured 2026-09-22: `gh:<id>` ×173,
//                  `hh:<slug>` ×17).
//   the LEDGER's   the town's `stamp-mint.mjs § householdKeys()` over the pins
//                  plus ADDRESS logins, folded forward by the ledger's dated
//                  `registry:` lines. That one is the ECONOMY's answer and it
//                  is date-shaped on purpose — it stays where it is.
//   the REGISTRY's `residency.mjs § houseForAccount / houseForName`, walking
//                  the registry's own rows.
//
// The first and the third asked the SAME question — which house does this
// account/handle/key belong to, right now — and answered it from two different
// places in two different spellings. That is the drift the ruling kills. This
// file is the third one's walk, generalised over every spelling the first one
// could be handed, and both now call it.
//
// THE LEDGER'S RESOLVER IS NOT FOLDED IN, and that is deliberate. "Which house
// does this handle belong to" has no date; "which key did this handle's mail
// mint under on 2026-07-13" does, and only the sealed ledger can answer it.
// Two questions, two resolvers, one of them here.
//
// ── IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `{ slug: null, via: "unknown" }` is a first-class answer. A caller that
// wanted `solo:<handle>` builds it from the refusal; nothing in here invents a
// house for a handle the registry has never heard of, because a fabricated
// household is worse than an absent one — it files a stranger inside somebody's
// walls, and the parcel cap, the consent gate and the draft row policy all read
// this answer as if it were a fact.

//
// `022_household_respell.sql` was going to re-spell `claims` and `marks` so a
// session keyed `hh:<slug>` could see drafts written under `gh:<id>`. THE STORE
// REFUSES IT, and by three separate laws, each measured on the dev sandbox
// 2026-09-22 (Wright's hand, a real Postgres):
//
//   `acts_append_only`     002_grants.sql — "an act is never edited"
//   `claims_update_guard`  007_private_drafts.sql — EVERY lawful transition
//                          requires `NEW.household IS NOT DISTINCT FROM
//                          OLD.household`. "A claim's household never changes."
//   `marks_id_is_fixed`    the same rule one table over
//
// The store's own law is that a row's household spelling is FIXED FOR ITS LIFE,
// and this file's header already said it from the other side: "earlier lines
// keep their spellings — history is not rewritten." So the defect 022 named is
// real and its fix was on the wrong side of the wall. THE FIX IS ON THE READ
// SIDE: a house declares every spelling it has ever carried, and the policy and
// every household filter compare against the set.
//
// ── WHICH SPELLINGS ARE ADMITTED, AND WHICH ARE NOT ─────────────────────────
//
// MEASURED on `test/fixtures/registry-2026-09-22/` — the town's own two files,
// byte-exact, 118 households / 190 pins:
//
//   `hh:<slug>`     118 — one per house. THE FIRST ENTRY, always.
//   `gh:<id>`       121 — every account the registry lists carries an id
//                         (0 of 121 are login-only), and three houses hold two.
//   `hh:<formerly>`   0 — POS-158 shipped the column and no door has reached
//                         it yet. Admitted anyway, because the moment one does
//                         a renamed house's old rows are exactly this problem.
//   `solo:<held>`   304 — every handle (190) and every account login (121)
//                         THIS house holds and nobody else's, less the 7 that
//                         are both at once. The follow-up below. 543 keys in
//                         all, over the town's 118 houses.
//
// ── `solo:` WAS REFUSED HERE, AND THE REFUSAL WAS WRONG ─────────────────────
//
// The first cut of this block excluded `solo:<handle>` on the rule "NAMES NO
// HOUSE", which is what `resolveHouse` still answers and what 022's own map
// said. IT WAS TRUE WHEN THE ROW WAS WRITTEN AND IT IS FALSE NOW, and the
// difference is POS-159's backfill: since that measurement every resident on
// the roll stands in exactly one house (188 of 188 by account), and the
// registry's own invariant is that a handle belongs to AT MOST ONE house. So a
// `solo:` spelling of a handle THE HOUSE ITSELF HOLDS is not a fabricated
// household — it is a historical spelling of that house, exactly as `gh:<id>`
// is, and the house is the only reader that can be handed it.
//
// MEASURED ON THE DEV SANDBOX 2026-09-22 21:11, after migration 024, a real
// Postgres: the store holds 10 draft claims under `solo:kadakatzenberg`. With
// `app.household_keys = 'hh:the-familiar-house'` alone their author sees 0 of
// them; with `solo:kadakatzenberg` in the set they see all 10; a stranger sees
// 0. That is RED 1, and this block is its fix.
//
// THE MEASURED ROW IS A LOGIN, NOT A HANDLE, and that is why two classes of
// string are admitted rather than one. `kadakatzenberg` is the GitHub login of
// `the-familiar-house`'s one account; its resident handle is
// `sophia-familiaris`. `world2-claims.mjs § THE ONE RESOLVER` writes
// `claims.household` from the ACTING KEY, and for a human-credentialed act
// that key is the human's GitHub login — so the `solo:` rows in the store are
// spelled with handles AND with logins, verbatim, case and all
// (`materialize.mjs`'s own header names three: `solo:devadavisson`,
// `solo:kristinashoultz-wq`, `solo:FluffUPando`). A set admitting only the
// handle spelling would leave the measured 10 drafts exactly where they are.
//
// SO: `solo:<x>` is admitted for every `x` this house holds —
//
//   its `residents[]` handles;
//   every handle whose PIN id is one of this house's account ids (the same
//     id-only road `VIA.PIN` walks, and for the same recycled-login reason);
//   every `accounts[].login` the house lists;
//   the `login` each of those handles' pins wears.
//
// MEASURED on the fixture: 190 distinct handles and 121 distinct logins are
// held this way (7 strings are both, for one house), giving 304 `solo:` keys,
// and NOT ONE of them is held by two houses — so every `solo:` key in the town
// belongs to exactly one house's set. `FALSIFIER 1g` asserts that census
// rather than trusting this paragraph, and it is the whole safety argument:
// the reason a bare `mari` is refused below is that a set has no order to
// disambiguate it, and `solo:mari` needs none — measured, it names starforge's
// resident and nothing else, while the house whose SLUG is `mari` carries
// `solo:ev-attractor` and no `solo:mari` at all.
//
// THE ONE COST, STATED RATHER THAN BURIED. The refusal this replaces named a
// real consequence: a `solo:` draft becomes readable by the author's HOUSEMATES
// and not only by the author, because 007's grain is the household and not the
// person. That is not a side effect of the set — it is what the household grain
// already means for every `hh:`-spelled draft in the store, and a `solo:` row
// written by a resident who now stands in a house is that house's row. The
// alternative on offer is the measured one: the author sees none of their own
// ten drafts. Ruling 4 takes the housemate over the locked drawer; if Keemin's
// word before Sunday's deploy prefers the drawer, the fix is a per-person carve
// on 007 and not a narrower set, because the same argument would then apply to
// every `gh:`-spelled draft this set already admits.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//
//   IT DOES NOT MOVE `resolveHouse`. A `solo:` key still answers `unknown`
//   there, so nothing that asks "which house IS this" — the write side, the
//   parcel-cap fold, a consent gate — changes its answer. The set is the READ
//   side's question ("which rows may this house see") and Ruling 4 is a read-
//   side ruling. One consequence is worth stating plainly rather than leaving
//   for a reader to trip over: `houseKeysOf('hh:letta')` now contains
//   `solo:wren-winter` while `houseKeysOf('solo:wren-winter')` is still `[]`.
//   That asymmetry is the ruling's shape, not an oversight, and FALSIFIER 1b
//   pins both halves of it.
//
//   IT DOES NOT LOWERCASE A LOGIN. 39 of the 121 live logins carry uppercase
//   and the pen wrote them verbatim, so the verbatim spelling is the one that
//   matches a row. A case-folded variant would be a second key admitted on a
//   guess about what some past writer did, and `= ANY(set)` cannot tell a
//   reader which of the two matched.
//
// AND TWO CLASSES STILL REFUSED, each for a reason a future reader will want:
//
//   BARE STRINGS     a bare slug, a bare handle, a bare login, a bare former
//                    slug. `resolveHouse` can read these safely ONLY BECAUSE IT
//                    IS ORDERED — a bare string is tried as a HANDLE first,
//                    precisely because three live handles are also some house's
//                    slug (`mari`, `moth`, `elias-returning`, measured
//                    2026-09-22). A SET HAS NO ORDER. `household = ANY(set)`
//                    matches on membership alone, so a bare `mari` in the set
//                    of ev-attractor's house would match a row that meant
//                    starforge's resident — a cross-household read, silently.
//                    Every admitted spelling is PREFIXED, which is 022's own
//                    rank-0 sentence: "a prefixed key says what it is; no
//                    ambiguity."
//
//   `login:<name>`   an ACCOUNT spelling whose match rule is conditional —
//                    `accountMatches` lets a login reach a house only where
//                    that house's row carries NO id for it. A set cannot carry
//                    a condition. Measured: 0 of 190 handles wear a `login:`
//                    key and every one of the 118 houses pins every account it
