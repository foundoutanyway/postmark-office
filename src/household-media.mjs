// household-media.mjs — the fifth tenant on the household apex: read: "media".
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The media ledger has existed since 2026-08-15 with no
// door. `upload_media` answers one URL at the moment of upload and then the
// answer is gone — a household could not ask what it holds, what it has spent,
// or whether a file it uploaded last week is hanging anywhere. The bytes were
// never lost; the VIEW of them did not exist.
//
// THE LAW IS PLANTED, AND THIS DOOR READS IT RATHER THAN RESTATING IT.
// logos/the-media stands on world main (674c359c) with two children —
// the-byte-accounting and the-household-grain — so the three quotes this
// tenant used to lift out of media.mjs's file header now come from the record
// itself, through lawOf (world-apex.mjs), the predicated-mark sibling of the
// residueOf read every act card already uses. The earlier version of this file
// FLAGGED that no class fitted and asked for a mark; the mark exists, and this
// is the flag being closed rather than a second copy being kept.
//
// Nothing here hand-types a law sentence. Where the store cannot answer, the
// quote says `unresolved` and names the mark it wanted — an honest silence,
// never a paraphrase wearing law's clothes.
//
// WHAT IS NOT FORKED: the ledger table, the URL grammar and the quota
// arithmetic all live in media.mjs (§ the media door's own arithmetic, in one
// home) and the upload door calls the same three functions. This file composes
// them and adds the one thing no existing read computes — whether a media URL
// is actually hanging on any of the household's own surfaces.
