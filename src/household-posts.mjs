// household-posts.mjs — a household's posts, one read, two readers (POS-293).
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-28: "Posts are what we want. Marks are what Postmark is.
// Mail is whom we trust." The household page opens on the first of the three,
// and this is its read: `household { read: "posts", handle }` (GET /household
// ?read=posts&handle=…), and the same answer as the doorstep's `posts` segment.
//
// ── TWO LISTS, FOR THE HANDLE'S WHOLE HOUSE ─────────────────────────────────
//
//   put_up       posts the house's residents authored
//   taking_part  posts by others where a resident of the house holds a
//                response (an RSVP, a stake on an idea)
//
// Each row carries ONLY the general fields (design-notes/posts-fields.md § 4):
// class, id, title, author, household, state, latest {act, at}, responses,
// role, stake, ours. Nothing reads a class's own `fields`, so a reader draws
// every class with one row and branches on `class` for nothing but a colour.
//
// ── THE CLASSES TODAY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// EVENTS are the `posts` table (028). The window is the calendar's: not ended,
// or ended within ENDED_LIST_DAYS. The state is the clock's, read at read time
// through `phaseAt` — the calendar's one phase decision — and named in the
// post's words: announced, live (doors open or underway), ended; cancelled is
// the one state an act stores. Nothing new is stored.
//
// IDEAS come two ways since POS-290. The Think Tank's MARKS are read where
// `town { read: "ideas" }` reads them (`ideasTank`) and backed where `town {
// read: "stake" }` reads the backing (the town engine's `worldStakeState`, the
// stamp ledger's world-stake rows). Every standing idea mark is in the window,
// and every one is `posted`. An idea mark's title is its body, resident text,
// never folded into a sentence of the office's. The idea POSTS (IDEA_POSTS) are
// the posts table's, read like the events (§ ideaPostRows): their state is
// their stage, and a resident who signed up to build a part takes part.
//
// QUESTS are not here. The town posts them and the household page keeps its
// quest board beside these lists.
//
// ── PUBLIC, AND IT NEVER LOOKS AT WHAT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────
//
// Posts, RSVPs and stakes are the town's public record. The responses query
// names its columns (post, handle, state); an RSVP's harness and budget live
// in `responses.fields` and `household_harnesses`, and this file reads neither.
//
// ── A HALF THAT CANNOT BE READ IS SAID ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each class is read on its own. One that does not answer leaves its rows out
// and puts a line in `unavailable` naming it, so a reader never takes "the
// record did not answer" for "the house has none".

// Wright, reviewing POS-294's shape: "one question, one owner". This house's
// read and the town's `posts` read (town-posts.mjs) ask the posts table the
// same question, a class's posts with their counted responses and their
// newest act, so they share this function and nothing else reads the table
// for them. What differs is only who is asking: the house keeps the posts
// its residents wrote or answered (`keep`), the town keeps them all.
//
// THE WINDOW is the class's. An event is in it while it has not ended or
// ended within ENDED_LIST_DAYS, the calendar's own window. A class with no
// span (a quest) has no window: every post of it is answered, open or not.
//
// Each row is the general row (posts-fields.md § 4) without the reader's own
// keys (role, stake, ours): class, id, title, author, household, state,
// latest, responses. `RESPONDENTS` (a symbol, never on an answer) carries who
// answered, for a reader that needs it; `STARTS` carries the span's start for
// the order.
