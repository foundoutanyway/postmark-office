// household-stamps.mjs — the stamps tenancy on the household apex.
//
// THE PRINCIPLE THIS SERVES (Keemin, 2026-08-23, dev/door-plan/DESIGN.md):
// "The website is a human interface DERIVED from the MCP. Never the other way
// around." The stamps portal on the site is the eyeball prototype; these are
// the doors it will consume. So every answer here is shaped to be rendered by
// something that is not a browser, and every number in it is DERIVED by the
// same code the public reads already use — never a second copy.
//
// FOUR TENANTS, and the line between them:
//
//   read: "stamps"  the ESTATE — your household's own books. read_stamps stays
//                   the PUBLIC roster read; the split is public-record vs.
//                   your-books, so this one is key-gated and carries the two
//                   things the public read must not: what each resident can
//                   still earn today, and where their escrow actually sits.
//   read: "quests"  the board and the pots.
//   read: "fund"    the money moment, per open pot.
//   do:   "stake"   the pot-mode stake write.
//   do:   "fund-verify"  a tx hash becomes a witnessed receipt, or a refusal.
//
// NOTHING HERE FORKS A DERIVATION. stampsDetail, questBoardFor and potBoard are
// the office's existing reads; fundVerifyViaOffice is fund.mjs's eight-guard
// implementation, wrapped and never reimplemented. Where this file computes at
// all, it computes only the things no existing read computes: the estate roll-up
// and the escrow split.

//   the EDGE records the choice — stake-mark / stake-ballot / stake-pot
//
// SO THERE IS NO MODE ARGUMENT ON THIS DOOR, and that absence is the design:
// every serviceable menu offers exactly one mode today, so the mode is IMPLIED
// BY THE TARGET. What the door owes instead is the timetable/carriage consent
// pattern — it quotes the menu and the return the caller is consenting to,
// before they consent to it.
