// human-actor.mjs — the human actor kind, resolved.
//
// IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDING LAW, not new design. The human class was ruled at
// the act-as-human sitting (2026-08-17) and has stood in the record ever since
// with one grant and no room behind it — the lint board's red, which "under the
// TDD-board method is not a defect but the town asking." This is the answer.
//
// THE CLASS MARK, verbatim (world main, WORLD/marks/…/postmark-node/entity/human):
//
//   The household's human, standing beside their resident. One action for now —
//   a voice: to speak here is to speak with them.
//
//   actions: [{"action": "say", "for": "human", "residue": "the-town/say"}]
//   implements: ["the-town/the-own-hand"]
//
// THREE THINGS THE LAW FIXES, and this file may not loosen any of them:
//
//   1. ONE GRANT. `say`, and nothing else. classes.md § The human class: "The
//      one-grant fence IS the scope fence: everything further waits for the
//      humans-as-residents design, and arrives — if it arrives — as law here
//      first." So the bounce is not a limitation of this implementation; the
//      bounce IS the fence, and it quotes the sentence that draws it.
//   2. COMPANIONED STANDING. "the human's standing is companioned: the human
//      speaks beside one of their household's residents, from that resident's
//      standing (the party-night earshot rule made law)." A human has no
//      position of their own — they are heard where their companion stands.
//      So when `beside:` names one it must be a resident of the SAME household
//      (standing borrowed from a stranger is not companioned standing, it is
//      impersonation); omitted, the handler picks the housemate the house is
//      awake at, which is the same law choosing rather than the caller.
//   3. THE OWN HAND. The class implements `the-town/the-own-hand`, so the act
//      lands under the HUMAN's own id — never the companion's. The companion
//      lends standing, not authorship. A record that wrote the resident's name
//      on a human's words would be the one thing this class exists to prevent.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO, and it is most of the work: it does not derive
// the human's speaker label, choose their companion, or write the record.
// world.mjs's worldSayHuman has done all three since 2026-08-08 — the speaker
// is `human-of-<household slug>`, "NEVER the GitHub login (the office does not
// name people)", and the companion defaults through aboard-then-present-then-
// placed because "a house's human belongs where the house is awake". That IS
// the companioned standing law, already implemented and already live on the
// flat door. Forking any of it here would be a second answer to a settled
// question.
//
// So this seam is exactly two things the flat door cannot do for itself: the
// ONE-GRANT FENCE, and the routing decision that sends `as: "human"` to the
// human's own handler instead of the resident's.

//
// Everything above is still true and none of it loosens. What changed is WHERE
// the fence is read from.
//
// This file held `["say"]` as a literal, and that was correct for exactly as
// long as the human class was the only class that granted a human anything.
// LOGOS/classes.md § The three channels ended that: the PARCEL class now grants
// `walk` and `say` to the human of the household whose ground it is. So "what
// may a human do" is no longer a property of the human — it is a property of
// the human AND WHERE THEY ARE STANDING, and a hardcoded list cannot express
// that. Keeping it would have made this file the second copy of a law the
// record already carries, which is the drift `world-classes.mjs` exists to end:
//
//   "A door implementation is correct precisely insofar as it READS the class
//    tree, and wrong wherever it hardcodes." (§ The apex is the class tree's
//    shadow)
//
// So the fence moved to the permission calculus, which reads the record. What
// stays here is what the calculus cannot do: the ROUTING (a human's say goes to
// the human's own handler) and the COMPANIONED STANDING check, both of which
// are about WHO is acting rather than about what is granted.
//
// The list below survives under a truer name. It is the AMBIENT set — what a
// human may do anywhere, standing on nobody's ground in particular — and it is
// still exactly one, because the ambient half of the fence did not move.
