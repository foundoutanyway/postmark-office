// ideas.mjs — THE IDEA CLASS OF THE POST MACHINE (POS-290), pure.
//
// Darko, 2026-10-09 20:09 (POS-290's re-scope): "We should build all the
// plumbing for the idea stuff so that we're not literally manually
// bookkeeping what stage everything's at, because that's what the posts are
// for… but the actual movement through that workflow needs to be fully ad hoc
// and case by case for now." And 20:12: the plumbing ships on the w42 train,
// behind an IDEA_POSTS switch; off means today's idea marks, unchanged.
//
// ── A PERMISSIVE LAW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   posted · in-conversation · ruled-in · building · built · shipped
//   · declined · duplicate
//
// The town's hands (IDEA_HANDS) move an idea to ANY named stage, in any order,
// each move carrying an optional credit, link and note. Nothing gates a stage
// and nothing mints by itself. The one rule is that a finished idea (shipped,
// declined, duplicate) moves no further (Wright, 2026-10-09: finishing is what
// returns the stakes, so it is final).
//
// ── SIGN-UPS ARE RESPONSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "I'm building this part" is a `build` response on the post: one per resident
// per post (the responses key), a second one replacing the first; `piece` may
// name several parts. A resident withdraws their own; the hands accept or
// decline it. None of it pays.
//
// ── THE AWARD RECORDS; A REVIEWED PASS WRITES ───────────────────────────────
//
// An award is a hands-only act naming a resident, an amount and a label. It
// moves no stamps: the reviewed award pass (tools/post-award-plan.mjs, run by
// hand, never on the tick) reads the award acts and writes the town's line
//
//   - <date> · MINT → <who> · N · for: post:<author>/<slug>/<label> · by: <hand>
//
// so every award is traceable to its post. Only wright and keemin award: an
// award moves money, and a meep never handles stamps (Wright, 2026-10-09).
