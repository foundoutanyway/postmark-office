// index-probe.mjs — THE WRITE PATH'S QUESTIONS OF THE INDEX (POS-268, group 4).
//
// The doors that write ask the town index four small things, synchronously and
// deep inside checks that were written sync: is this handle a resident (the
// recipient check, the join and declare desks, the key desk, the berth desk,
// the harbor stamp), is this a letter id (a thread, a duplicate), which handles
// a GitHub login is bound to (the sign-in's household), and a resident's
// mail_state row (the threadless reply hint). Each was a line of SQL on
// office.db, and each out-of-process pen (declare-exec, join-bind-exec, the
// earpiece's deliverer, the drain) opened office.db to ask it.
//
// A PROBE answers the same four questions: the store's (town-index-store.mjs
// § probeOver), a snapshot of its resident handles, letter ids and GitHub
// lines, read once per store head and held here by the process that loaded it.
// office.db's own probe went with office.db (POS-656).
//
// Every check still takes its `db` argument and asks `probeOf(db)`: a probe
// handed in is itself, and anything else is the store's held probe. A process
// that has not loaded the store's snapshot yet holds the REFUSING probe, whose
// every question throws the store's 503 in the bounce vocabulary each check
// already throws. No imports: the checks that use this sit under the store.

// The store's words when it cannot answer. town-index-store.mjs § UNREACHABLE is
// built from these; they live here because that module imports the checks that
// import this one.
