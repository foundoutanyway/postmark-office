// join-bind.mjs — admission is the bind: a house adding its own resident.
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-29, Household Primary Key reopened): the office
// decides whatever a machine can decide, and a PR exists only when a person has
// to. When `request_residency` comes from an account the house already lists
// (`planRegistryJoin` answers `vouched`: appended by account, or a house this
// account is founding or naming for itself), nobody has anything to decide. So
// the resident is bound — pin and membership, `joinHousehold` — in the same act
// that writes their address, and no PR is opened.
//
// Before this, that request opened a join PR whose merge admitted the address
// and bound nothing: no path wrote the pin for a PR join, and the welcome pass
// paid the unpinned handle's house a second time under its card username
// (Wildcat #3217, Scout #3244; the trace at docs/2026-09-29/join-flow).
//
// THE SHAPE IS `src/declare-exec.mjs`'s. The critical section below runs as a
// child under the town lock (`join-bind-exec.mjs`), after a pull: it re-reads
// the registers from the record, re-runs the checks the witness ran on the PR
// (the handle is free on base, the card is valid, the card names the verified
// account), mints the house if it is new, joins the handle to it, prints both
// registers with `collectingDrain`, and lands the card, the two mailboxes and
// the two printed files in ONE `penCommit`.
//
// THE STORE UNREACHABLE REFUSES. A join that cannot read the record cannot tell
// a vouched request from a held one, so it opens nothing and admits nobody:
// never a PR, and never an address without its bind. The caller tries again.
