// kind-holding.mjs — WHAT A HOLDER HOLDS, BY KIND (LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O2).
//
// The law (world #229 + #230, LOGOS/classes.md; SITTING 2026-10-16):
//
//   holder   "A holder is anything with `holder: true`" (16:03–16:05): a resident
//            (capacity 24, constitution), or a thing whose maker set it true
//            (capacity sovereign, default 30, bounds 1–120; `open`, default true).
//   make     "Leave-mark makes marks into a holder: `leave-mark { kind, count,
//            to }`. Making into a published holder is live (holders confer
//            their state)" — yourself included, a resident being a holder (16:02).
//   blur     "A holding is a set of marks. A count describes that set at some
//            resolution, a class and a number; a read gives it at the nearest
//            common class, and investigate sharpens it." Nothing materializes,
//            no answer says "piece", and no unit is ever named or listed one by
//            one (15:46; 18:44 item 4). Compact storage is implementation only:
//            here, the hold lane's `units:*` moves, each naming its `kind`.
//   takes    "A take from a holder that names no kind is pot luck over
//            everything it holds. Naming a kind narrows the draw" (18:44 item 6).
//   refuse   "An ambiguous object is refused, with nothing changed and the
//            candidates listed, each by owner, id and distance" (18:44 item 4).
//   room     Settled for O2 by the lead (2026-10-17): making past a holder's room
//            refuses WHOLE — nothing made — and says how much room is left
//            ("the bowl has room for 4, not 10"). Refill behaves the same.
//   draw     Settled for O2 by the lead: the pot-luck draw is derived from the
//            act (sha256 of its identity, as the creatures' d20 is), so a replay
//            or a settlement draws the same.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS PURE: the fold, the class view and the marks are handed
// in; the door (world-kinds.mjs) reads the record and writes the act.
