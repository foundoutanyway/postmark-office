// last-active.mjs — WHEN A RESIDENT LAST DID SOMETHING IN TOWN (POS-481).
//
// Darko, 2026-10-09: "to be able to see when that resident was last active on
// Postmark … so residents can get a sense of, if I'm new here and I send a
// letter to this one resident, would they likely be responsive or have they
// been gone for months?"
//
// ONE MEANING: the resident's newest act of their own. Wright ruled the
// sources (POS-481, 10-09): the store's `acts` (every world act, every post
// and its life, every ballot vote) UNION ALL the store's `town_letters` (a
// letter they sent, at the crossing that sailed it) UNION ALL the page edits,
// `office_town_journal` class `update` (address, home, profile, window:
// ruled in after the review, O3, so a resident who re-hangs a window or
// edits HOME reads active). Reads never count: a read is not recorded, and
// counting one would publish who is reading. Mail delivered TO them is not
// their act. Left out, by ruling and named: stakes on pots and marks
// (`stamp_lines` keeps the staker inside the signed line, with no actor
// column). The page edits are the store's since the paperwork moved there
// (OFFICE_PAPERWORK_STORE, prod since 10-04); an office still on oauth.db
// keeps them in that file, and this read does not see them.
//
// Until this file, `last_active` on the roster meant "the newest commit
// touching their own pages in the town repo" (town-index.mjs § readHistory),
// which never saw a say, a walk or a mark. The field keeps its name and its
// type, an ISO string, so nothing that reads it breaks (Wright's ruling B);
// what it means is this file's answer, and `last_active_crossing` rides beside
// it. The index's history value is still built and kept in the index; no door
// serves it any more.
//
// THE CROSSING is the town clock (crossings.mjs) read at the winning time:
// `currentCrossing(at)` for an act and for a letter alike (the spec as
// amended, Wright 2026-10-09), never `acts.crossing` (a backfilled row can
// carry another) and never a second counter. A letter's time is its
// `delivered_at`, the boat that sailed it, which lags the send by up to one
// crossing; Wright accepted that at the granularity of a date and a crossing.
//
// ONE STATEMENT PER PAGE, never one per resident: the handles of the page go
// in as one array and every one of them comes back from one round trip.

import { currentCrossing } from "./crossings.mjs";

/**
 * The newest act per handle from each source, one row per (handle, source).
 * The acts half is a scan and a sort: measured on the dev sandbox (14,042
 * acts, a 50-handle page) the planner took a seq scan, a sort on (actor, at)
 * and a Unique, 26.7 ms; `acts_actor_id_idx (actor, id)` does not order by
 * `at`, so it cannot serve the DISTINCT ON. Prod held about 15,100 acts on
 * 2026-10-09 (Wright, read-only), so no index this week; `acts (actor, at
 * DESC)` is the migration if the table grows past that comfort. Letters
 * filter on `town_letters_from (from_h, date)`. `delivered_at` is text (UTC
 * ISO, town-index.mjs § readHistory), so its max is a string compare and the
 * instant is parsed here, never cast in SQL where one odd row would fail the
 * whole page. The act's instant is printed in the same UTC ISO, so the
 * sources compare as like for like. A page edit's `written_at` is the door's
 * own `toISOString()` (town-journal.mjs § appendTownJournal), and its
 * resident is `handle` (the page edited); the filter rides
 * `office_town_journal_handle (handle, seq)`.
