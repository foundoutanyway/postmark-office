// write). Does the whole critical section in one process against the WORLD clone
// (postmark-world), which is separate from the town clone: pull, write the mark
// at its filing (its frozen path if the manifest names it, else its id — the
// freeze, 2026-08-25; the Settlement no longer re-homes anything),
// select/lazy-create draft/<household>, write the mark.md into that branch's
// tree, commit the record only, and push best-effort (a 403 is logged once and
// reported push-pending, never thrown). Prints one JSON line.
//
// A DRAFT COSTS NOTHING (Keemin-ruled 2026-08-22, the ship after the fold

  // so their numbers do not change; an old clone (no worldToFile) keeps v2
  // behavior byte-for-byte.
  //
  // WHAT THE GATE DOES AND DOES NOT REFUSE. This comment used to end "if this
  // conversion is ever wrong, the lint+fold gate below refuses the write — the
  // door cannot land a misplaced record". There IS no gate below: a draft costs
  // nothing (header, 2026-08-22), and the lint and the fold run at the
  // Settlement, not here. What they judge is whether a record PARSES and whether
  // its composed footprint is admissible — overlap, standing, consent. A number
  // written in the wrong frame parses, and it composes to a real point on the
  // ground, so it is admissible: the gate reads a mark that has MOVED, not a
  // mark that is misplaced, and it has no way to tell the two apart. Nothing
  // downstream refuses this; getting the origin right here is the whole guard.
  // It did not, twice — `vermillion/the-pando-peak` (2026-08-27, fixed at the
  // drain) and `current-the-reader/the-snug-mooring` (2026-09-14, world
  // `3a3a645c`: the resident's correct absolute landed in a nested slot and the
  // fold read it as an offset, 5 km out to sea).
  //
  // THE ORIGIN, for a sited/parcel mark the frozen manifest already nests. Such
  // a mark carries no `parent_id` — geometry decides its containment — so the
  // `parentId` test below is false for it and the conversion was skipped
  // entirely: the resident's ABSOLUTE went into a relative slot verbatim. A
  // FRESH sited leave files at `WORLD/marks/<by>/<slug>/`, which is root level,
  // where absolute IS the file frame and nothing needs shifting; the hole is
  // only the amend of a fossil, whose filing is nested. Its origin is the
  // composed centre of the mark that FRAMES it — the same anchor
  // `world-journal.mjs § pathFor` takes ("the innermost containing mark is the
  // anchor") and the same one `world-drain.mjs § fileFramer` already takes.
  //
  // Read from the fold's own answer for that record (`_origin`), not
  // re-derived from the directory: the frame is the nearest positioned ancestor
  // THAT BINDS the record (marks-fold § the tier binding), which steps past an
  // ancestor the record outranks. Measured on world `58d4722e`, 7 of the 385
  // frozen nested sited marks are framed on a mark that is NOT their directory
  // parent, so a directory-parent centre would file those 7 against a frame the
  // fold does not use — the same defect in a new place. The fossil the manifest
  // names but the tree no longer holds has no such record; it falls back to the
  // mark standing in `parentDir` (which IS `dirname(fossilDir)` by construction
