// mark-declared-parent.mjs — A MARK THAT DECLARES ITS PARENT MUST STAND IN IT.
//
// ── THE LIVE CASE (postmark#3020, Linear POS-147) ────────────────────────────
//
// `current-the-reader/the-snug-mooring` is filed, by the 2026-08-25 freeze, at
//
//   WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/the-doubled-coast/the-snug-harbour/the-snug-mooring/mark.md
//
// — inside the harbour, and the harbour's composed centre is (-350, 4978). Its
// owner's 2026-09-14T17:02Z amend carried the WORLD point (-358, 4972), which is
// exactly where the mooring stood; the file's own number was (-8, -6). The
// 2026-09-15T17:46Z crossing (world `3a3a645c`, BEFORE the 2026-09-18 framer)
// wrote the world number raw into the relative file, the fold composed it
// against the harbour, and the mooring resolved to (-708, 9950) — five
// kilometres out to sea, where it stayed through S71, S72 and S73, and where
// three placements lost it as their parent.
//
// The 2026-09-18 framer (postmark#2865, the Berthillon carriage) closed the raw
// write. It did not close the second half, and the second half is this file:
// the framer converts whatever world point it is handed, faithfully. Hand it a
// point five kilometres from the declared parent and it writes a file that says
// "in the harbour" over a geometry that says "at sea". The conversion is not
// wrong; the input is, and nobody was asking.
//
// ── THE RULING (Keemin, 2026-09-20, verbatim) ────────────────────────────────
//
//   "1) absolute coords are what it takes (the written schema is correct, the
//    current behavior is wrong)
//    2) if marks DECLARE their parent, refuse at that lands outside the parent.
//    If they DON'T, dont, and parent just gets computed by geometry (which is
//    the way it should be)"
//
// (1) is already true and has been since 2026-09-18 — `at` at the door is
// absolute, the file is frame-relative, and the carriage converts once. This
// module is (2), and only (2).
//
// ── WHAT "DECLARE" MEANS HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A NEW FIELD ─────────────────
//
// A mark never authors a `parent` — `leave-exec.mjs` ~313 says it outright: "a
// sited/parcel mark never authors a parent (geometry decides)". What an EXISTING
// mark has instead is a FROZEN FILING PATH, and the path is where containment is
// declared: `WORLD/filing-freeze.json` is the manifest, minted once on
// 2026-08-25 and never regenerated, and the fold composes a nested file against
// the mark that owns its parent directory. So:
//
//   · a mark WITH a frozen path under another mark DECLARES that mark as its
//     parent, and an `at` outside it is refused;
//   · a mark with NO frozen path is a create — Gate B files it root-framed at
//     `WORLD/marks/<by>/<slug>/` and geometry places it, untouched by this;
//   · a mark whose path-parent is the WORLD ROOT declares nothing but the world,
//     and is likewise untouched. The root is the frame, not a parent.
//
// That is the ruling's second sentence, already true, left exactly as it is.
//
// ── ONE PREDICATE, ONE WORD, ONE SENTENCE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two doors have to agree or the resident hears one answer at the door and a
// different one at the crossing:
//
//   · `src/world.mjs § journalLeaveMark` — the amend branch, so the owner is
//     told at once, in the same breath as the carry forecast;
//   · `src/store-writedown.mjs` — the framing block, so a row that reached the
//     journal some other way is set aside at the crossing rather than written.
//
// Neither computes containment itself. Both hand THIS module the clone's own
// `pointWithinMark` (tools/world-verbs.mjs — the same function the enter door
// adjudicates with and `leavingWhileOccupying` walks with) and the parent as the
// last fold composed it. One derivation, two doors; the refusal word and the
// sentence are minted here so they cannot drift apart.

// "DID THE GROUND MOVE" — the move guard's own test, kept here when the guard
// itself was retired (POS-441, 2026-10-07: a move now carries its household's
// marks instead of being refused). This module was its one other reader, so the
// test lives where it is still asked, unchanged.

// ── THE NARROWING (Keemin's ruling carried by Wright, 2026-09-20) ────────────
//
// The first cut of this guard asked only "is the point outside?", and measuring
// it against the live record said what that costs: NINE standing marks would
// have had their next amend refused, and EIGHT of them declare a REGION whose
// ring the founder himself redrew on 2026-08-24. `WORLD/region-outsiders.md`
// says it plainly — *"Nothing has been moved and nothing is lost — the ground is
// exactly where its owner put it; only the region boundary changed."* Because an
// amend rewrites `data` whole from the claim, those eight owners would have met
// a 409 for changing a picture, over a boundary change that was not their act.
//
// The ruling: *"the ruling is against INTRODUCING or MOVING a displacement; the
// founder's own ring redraw is not the owner's act, and a words-only amend of
// one of those eight must go through."* So the containment question is asked
// only of an amend that actually moves the mark.
//
// ONE FUNCTION, BOTH DOORS. `declaredParentRefusal` is what the amend door and
// the crossing's write-down each call — not the raw predicate above, which stays
// as the pure containment primitive its unit tests drive. A gate that lived at
// two call sites is a gate one of them will eventually forget.

/**
 * Did this amend move the mark's GROUND, as opposed to its words?

 * `geometryMoved` is the retired move guard's own test, kept above, unchanged.
 *
 * ONE ADDITION, DELIBERATE AND DISCLOSED: `geometryMoved` reads `at` and
 * `extent` and does not look at `points`. This guard DOES test ring points for
 * containment, so gating it on a mover that cannot see a ring would leave an
 * amend that drags a ring outside its parent — a real displacement, introduced
 * by the owner — admitted by a guard that then checks the very points it was
 * told had not moved. The ring arm is named `"points"` and tested. It was not in
 * the word given; it is here because the ruling's own sentence is "introducing
 * or moving a displacement", and a ring move is one. Strike it by deleting the
