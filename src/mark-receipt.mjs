// mark-receipt.mjs — THE CANON RECEIPT: what happened to your mark, and where.
//
// THE PROMISE THIS KEEPS, verbatim, from the town's own bulletin entry
// `the-world` — a sentence the town published and did not keep:
//
//   "The World runs on the clock; judgment runs on the Worldkeeper. If your
//    mark does not ride a crossing, the reason is knowable — held, contested,
//    unbacked, or malformed — and the door will tell you which."
//
// and from `LOGOS/the-response-function § Residents: words, at their own pace`,
// which the plan of record names as the clause the town is breaking:
//
//   the resident's loop is "a replayable, cursor-ordered read of every effect
//   on your own node since you last looked" — and a crossing publishing or
//   refusing your mark is an effect on your node.
//
// ── THE WALK THAT PRODUCED IT (2026-09-06 05:53 EDT, #2526) ────────────────
//
// One staked mark, one crossing later, five doors, five different answers and
// none of them the promised one: the focus said "no mark or terrain feature";
// the marks shadow said `drafts / status: added`; the escrow said 1✦ standing;
// the `backed` row said `yours: false` with every field null; `since:` said,
// with a completeness guarantee, that nothing had happened to the resident.
//
// ── IT IS A DERIVED, AND IT IS STORED BY NOBODY ────────────────────────────
//
// `LOGOS/classes.md § The derived`: "a value the record implies at a save —
// computed at the read, stored never, authored by nobody." So there is no new
// table, no new column, and no new file. Every field below is read out of a
// record that already holds it:
//
//   status/window/cause   `claims` (status, window_id, submitted_at,
//                         decided_at, refusal_check) — world2/schema/001+007
//   crossing/sha          the world repo's own `settlement/S<n>` TAGS, which
//                         `settlements.mjs` already reads: "the truth is the
//                         world repo's own git TAGS … which exist only when a
//                         settlement actually landed"
//   published             canon — `publishedState(repo).state.marks`
//   draft (private)       the household's own delta — the sketchbook half
//
// ── THE PURE HALF, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `receiptFrom` takes RECORDS, not a repo and not a key, for the reason
// `world-hold.mjs § deps` gives: "deps exist so the ordering can be proven on a
// hand-built store with no world db and no Postgres — the door injects the real
// ones." Every sentence a resident reads is decided here, where a falsifier can
// hand it any tense without a settlement, a candle, or a clone.

// ── the clock, named every time (R4) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THREE CLOCKS WEAR THE WORD "CROSSING" and the walk found all three in one
// sitting: the world's `since:` cursor counts 12h crossings from 00:00/12:00Z
// (`crossings.mjs § CROSSING_DERIVATION`), the ferry sails the mail on the same
// 00/12Z beat, and the keeper's SETTLEMENT runs at 05:45/17:45Z and numbers its
// blessings S1, S2, … — "the number counts blessings, not beats"
// (`settlements.mjs`), so it cannot be derived from any clock at all.
//
// This receipt speaks in the SETTLEMENT's epoch and says so on every answer.
// `window` is the candle's, and it is labelled as the candle's. Nothing here
// re-uses the bare word "crossing" for either.

/**
 * The bulletin's own five words for why a mark did not ride.
 *
 * A refusal names a CHECK (`claims.refusal_check`, "refused always names its
 * failing check — attributable by construction", 001_tables.sql) and a resident
 * was promised one of FIVE WORDS. This is the only place the two vocabularies
 * meet, and it is a map rather than a rename: `cause` is the promised word and
 * `cause_row` always carries the record it came from, so nothing is lost in the
 * translation and a reader can go check.
 *
 * ⚑ AN UNMAPPED CHECK IS NOT "malformed". It answers `null` with the raw check
 * beside it, because guessing one of five promised words for a refusal nobody
 * has classified would be the town keeping its promise in appearance only.
 *
 * ── THE COLUMN HOLDS `<name>: <detail>`, AND THE FIRST MAP READ THE WHOLE
 *    STRING (repaired 2026-09-07, reviewer-measured) ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version of this map was built from the SWEEP's channel names and
 * never measured against the writers that actually fill the column. Every one
 * of them — `world2/tools/clearing-job.mjs` at 129, 131, 141, 158, 176, 190-191
 * and `world2/tools/review-rule.mjs` at 247-248 — writes `<name>: <detail>`:
 *
 *     duplicate: a standing mark already carries this slug
 *     superseded: a later claim in this candle amends this one
 *     insufficient-stamps: staked 3, liquid 1 at town 9f2a1b0c
 *     parcel-overlap: standing parcel "k-of-garrison/the-long-field"
 *     counterclaim: collides with 77 — a mind rules (census D2)
 *     review-ruling: wright refused this contest — <because>
 *
 * A map keyed on whole strings matched **0 of 8**. So every refusal the town
 * can currently produce answered `cause: null` — the `null`-rather-than-guess
 * discipline is the only reason that was an honest silence rather than a lie,
 * and it is the reason this was a repair and not an incident.
 *
 * THE CHECK IS THE PREFIX. Split on the FIRST colon: the detail carries commas,
 * quotes, em-dashes and its own colons ("review-ruling: wright refused this:
 * it collides"), and only the segment before the first one is a check name.
 *
 * `test/mark-receipt.test.mjs § REAL_REFUSAL_CHECKS` holds all eight verbatim
 * with the line each came from. A ninth prefix is not guessed at — it answers
 * `null` and says so, which is asserted there too.
 */
/**
 * ⚑ `unpublished` IS THE SIXTH WORD, RULED BY KEEMIN 2026-09-08 (postmark#2594).
 *
 * The bulletin's published sentence promises four — "held, contested, unbacked,
 * or malformed" — and `quarantined` was already a fifth this file carried. The
 * nightly read's canon-absent FINDING — nothing at the candle writes it; the
 * lock-time refusal was withdrawn the same day — is none of them: the record is typically well
 * formed, nobody else claims the slug, the stake is fine, and `held` is spent on
 * `held_review` and defined as "it did not ride and IT WAS NOT REFUSED". It has
 * a name — the world has no file for it — and the ruling is that a refusal with
 * a name must not answer null.
 *
 * THE BULLETIN'S OWN SENTENCE IS NOT THIS REPO'S TO EDIT. `the-world`'s entry
 * lives in the town repo and is mirrored into the site's `bulletin.json`; the
 * office answering a word the bulletin does not list is a seam, and it is
 * carried up in `docs/2026-09-08/jetto-candle-refusal-report.md` with the exact
 * sentence to change rather than edited here.
 */
/**
 * ⚑ `opposed` IS THE SEVENTH WORD, RULED BY DARKO 2026-10-08 (POS-364).
 *
 * A parcel over one of the town's limits (the-town/claim-cap, the-town/one-per-
 * resident) is decided at the clearing as OPPOSED, citing the law mark, and
 * never holds ground (world2/tools/parcel-cap.mjs § opposedCheck). Governance
 * taking a claim away, citing the law, is none of the six: nobody else claims
 * it (not contested), the stake is fine (not unbacked), the record is fine (not
 * malformed), and nothing waits on a person (not quarantined, not held, not
 * unpublished). The town's and a parcel holder's stance oppositions return a

 * added the mark's file, and the `settlement/S<n>` tags that contain it.
 *
 * Two git calls, on the clone the office already keeps. Null — never a guess —
 * when either is unreadable: an invented S-number on a receipt is worse than an
 * absent one, because the resident has no way to tell it is invented.
 *
 * ── THE OLDEST ADD, AND `--follow` (repaired 2026-09-07, reviewer-measured) ──
 *
 * The first version ran `--diff-filter=A **-1**` and called the answer "the
 * FIRST settlement that carried it". Both halves of that were wrong, and each
 * broke a different real case, measured on a tagged fixture:
 *
 *   a mark AMENDED after publication   truth S2 · answered S2   ok
 *   a mark WITHDRAWN and RE-LEFT       truth S4 · answered S6   wrong
 *   a mark whose FILE MOVED            truth S7 · answered S8   wrong
 *
 *   `-1` returns git's FIRST output line, which is the NEWEST add — so a slug
 *        let go and taken up again named the second arrival.
 *   no `--follow` makes a rename read as an add at the new path — so the
 *        receipt printed the settlement that MOVED the file as the settlement
 *        that CARRIED the mark, with a real sha.
 *
 * The move is the live one: the filing freeze says "the settlement writes a
 * mark once; nothing moves it after", and the-town's own class marks were moved
 * in August anyway. A wrong S-number with a real sha behind it is exactly what
 * this function's own null-rather-than-guess rule exists to prevent, so it was
 * failing at the one thing it was written to do.
 *
 * Each flag fixes a different case and BOTH are needed: `--follow` alone still
 * answers S6 for the re-leave, oldest-add alone still answers S8 for the move.
 * `test/mark-receipt.test.mjs § THE THREE LIVES A MARK'S FILE CAN HAVE`.
