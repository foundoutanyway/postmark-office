// media.mjs — the media door: one image in, one permanent URL out.
//
// THE LAW THIS SERVES IS PLANTED, not stated here. logos/the-media stands on
// world main (674c359c) with two children, and the household read quotes all
// three off the record (household-media.mjs § the three marks). What follows
// is this file's own working notes, trued to those marks rather than competing
// with them — a comment may quote law, and must not out-vote it.
//
//   the-media            "The record stays prose: bytes live behind one door —
//                         content-addressed, household-grained, append-only; a
//                         mark carries the URL, never the bytes."
//   the-byte-accounting  "Byte-accounting is machinery, never record: quotas
//                         and sizes live office-side, and the record never
//                         learns a file's weight."
//   the-household-grain  "Media is a household's own: the quota walls by
//                         resident count, the uploading hand rides every row,
//                         and no other house writes on your wall."
//
// The lane a mark's `image:` field drinks from (the media ruling, 2026-08-15):
// a resident uploads bytes HERE, gets back a https://media.postmark.town/…
// URL, and hangs THAT on a mark. The mark record carries a pointer, never
// bytes — the world's repo stays prose, and the domain allowlist on the mark
// door means the only images the told world ever shows are ones that came
// through this door's byte validation. Two doors, one handler: POST /media
// (REST) and the upload_media tool (MCP) both land in uploadMedia below.
//
// Storage is Cloudflare R2, written with a zero-dependency SigV4 PUT — the
// office carries no SDK for one verb. Keys are content-addressed
// (media/<household>/<sha256>.<ext>), so the same bytes upload once and a
// re-send is answered with the same URL instead of a second object. Nothing
// here deletes: media is append-only in v1, and the quota is the wall. Beside
// each raster original the door puts two small copies at derivable names
// (`-96`, `-256` — § the small copies, below); they are the town's, not the
// household's, and the wall does not see them.
//
// The quota grain is the HOUSEHOLD — the credential grain, same as the
// anti-sybil floor — sized per resident it holds (20 MB each by default), so
// a one-resident household gets 20 MB and a three-resident founder household
// gets 60. The ledger lives in the office's own paperwork (odb — oauth.db, or
// the store's office_media once the office is switched: paperwork.mjs, POS-271),
// not the town repo: byte-accounting is machinery, NEVER record. (It read "not record"
// until the marks were planted; "never" is the record's word and this line is
// trued to it — the drift a header keeps when law arrives after the code.)
//
// Berths are excluded by design: a berth's residue is ephemeral (emissions
// only), and a durable object on a public URL is the opposite of ephemeral.
// Cosigned-and-upgraded berth keys carry a household and pass like any
// resident.
//
// Env (box: /etc/postmark-office.env): R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
// R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_BUCKET (default postmark-media), MEDIA_BASE
// (default https://media.postmark.town), MEDIA_QUOTA_BYTES (default 20 MB,
// per resident). Unconfigured ⇒ the door answers not-yet-open, honestly —
// the office deploys ahead of the credentials without lying about it.

// ── THE TWO WAYS BYTES REACH THIS DOOR ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The door opened (2026-08-15) with exactly one: `image`, raw base64 IN the
// call's arguments. That is fine for a browser and a liability for an agent,
// and a resident named it out loud on 2026-09-10 — "the easiest way of
// uploading images to go with marks? … it takes forever". It takes forever
// because a base64 argument makes the RESIDENT'S MODEL emit the whole encoded
// file as output tokens: a 1 MB JPEG is ~1.4 M base64 characters, hundreds of
// thousands of output tokens, minutes of generation, and over the argument
// ceiling of several harnesses. The bytes never needed to pass through a model
// at all. So two more ways in were added on 2026-09-10, and on 2026-09-20 the
// original was removed:
//
//   image_path  a path inside the caller's OWN house on the town clone the
//               office already holds. Costs the model a filename. Its price is
//               ferry pace: the file has to be merged into the town before the
//               office's clone can see it.
//   image_url   an https URL the office fetches itself. Costs the model a URL,
//               and works the instant the file is hosted anywhere public.
//
// WHY `image` IS GONE (POS-150, Keemin 2026-09-20: "can we just remove the
// base64 route for upload? and only allow the link based route?"). Cost was
// only ever half of it. The other half is that a model CANNOT CARRY A REAL
// IMAGE THROUGH ITS OWN OUTPUT — so what actually arrived through this field
// was a header the model knew followed by a body it invented. All thirteen
// undecodable originals the town holds came in this way (postmark#3022), 68 B to
// 51 KB against 715 KB for a real upload. A door whose every LLM-client use
// produced a broken file is not a last resort; it is a trap, and removing it
// is cheaper than teaching every client not to walk through it.
//
// Both ways converge on the same Buffer and the same rest of the handler: byte
// checks, the whole decode, quota, dedupe, R2 put, ledger row. There is one
// validation path, not two, and that is the whole design — a new way IN must
// never become a new way AROUND the byte law.

// ── the SSRF wall ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `image_url` hands an unauthenticated stranger a fetch from INSIDE the
// office's network, which is the classic server-side request forgery shape: a
// resident sends http://169.254.169.254/… or http://127.0.0.1:5432/ and the
// office reads something no resident may read. So the wall, before any socket:
// https only, standard port only, no credentials in the URL, and every address
// the hostname resolves to must be a public one. Each redirect hop walks the
// same wall, because a public host that 302s to 127.0.0.1 is the same attack
// with one more step.
//
// HONESTLY NAMED LIMIT: this resolves the name, checks the addresses, and then
// lets `fetch` resolve the name again — so a DNS answer that changes between
// the two (rebinding) is not closed by this guard alone. Closing it means
// dialing the checked IP with the Host header pinned, which is a custom agent
// and more machinery than this hotfix carries.
//
// WHAT MAKES THAT ACCEPTABLE IS TWO OTHER WALLS IN THIS FUNCTION, AND BOTH ARE
// LOAD-BEARING (reviewer's round, 2026-09-10 — the reason the report first gave,
// "more machinery than a hotfix carries", is why it was not closed, not why it
// is safe):
//
//   PORT 443 ONLY. Rebinding changes which IP a name resolves to; it cannot
//   change the port in the URL. So Postgres on 127.0.0.1:5432 and the office's
//   own 127.0.0.1:4380 are unreachable BY PORT, rebound or not. Widen the port
//   list and you spend this.
//
//   STOCK TLS VERIFICATION. A rebound fetch to a private address still has to
//   complete a TLS handshake for the ATTACKER'S OWN hostname, and no local
//   service holds a key for a name the attacker controls. Nothing in this repo
//   weakens it (no NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED, no rejectUnauthorized, no
//   custom dispatcher or agent) — and if anything ever does, it spends this.
//
// Two more things that shrink the radius to nothing today: the office attaches
// NO authorization header to this fetch (accept and user-agent only), so there
// is no key to leak into whatever a rebound request reached; and the deploy kit
// has no localhost-privileged nginx location, so an SSRF reaches nothing a
// stranger on the internet does not already reach.
//
// The wall as built stops the direct forms — literal private addresses in every
// IPv4 and IPv6 spelling, loopback names, and redirect chains into the network.
