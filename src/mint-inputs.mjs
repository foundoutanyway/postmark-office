// mint-inputs.mjs — what the stamp mint decides from, read from the store
// (POS-341, ruled by Darko 2026-10-04).
//
// The mint (town tools/stamp-mint.mjs § --append) decides every correspondence
// mint, friendship mint, transfer and void from three inputs:
//
//   the ledger      the recorded lines, their laws and their sealed `registry:`
//                   revisions. In the store: stamp_lines (066, src/stamp-lines.mjs).
//   the key base    "which household shares a cap", from genesis: the pins, then
//                   each room's ADDRESS login, then `solo:<room>`. In the store:
//                   household_pins (019) and town_rooms (067).
//   the deliveries  the mail ledger's delivered letters, `pays:` included. In the
//                   store: town_mail_lines (067).
//
// This file DERIVES the two 067 projections from a town checkout (the ingest's
// half), WRITES them (the ingest calls writeMintInputs in its seed and its
// delta), and READS all three back into the shapes the town's own engine takes
// (the runner's half). The law stays the town's: the runner hands these to the
// engine's own deriveMints, deriveTransfers and walkLedger.
//
// ── TWO THINGS ARE RESTATED HERE, AND THE PARITY GATE HOLDS BOTH ─────────────
//
// `roomRows` restates how householdKeys walks the rooms and reads an ADDRESS
// login, and `keyBaseOf` restates householdKeys' order: a pin first unless the
// ledger sealed that handle before the pin's own date, then the room's login,
// then solo. The engine computes both inside one function over a checkout and
// exports neither half. The ruled gate (world2/tools/stamp-mint-parity.mjs) is
// base(store) = base(file) for every handle plus a replay green with the store
// base injected, so a drift here reds the gate before it reaches a mint.
// The deliveries are NOT restated: the town's parseDeliveries reads the raw
// lines (deliveriesOf).
