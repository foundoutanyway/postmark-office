// mists-forecast.mjs — WHEN THE MISTS REACH A MARK (WLD-38, the doorstep and
// placement half; the gate half shipped in World#194).
//
// Wright, AUTHORITY 2026-10-13T05:16:12Z: the forecast is the EARLIEST ACTUAL
// integer crossing at which the advancing Mists reach a mark — by the World
// engine's own interpolation, crossing by crossing over the authored schedule,
// never the next keyframe — with the FRINGE (sight shortened) and the WALL
// (hidden) reported separately. An unreadable forecast is NONFATAL and named
// `mists-forecast-unavailable: <why>`, never a false "clear". A mark the wall
// already stands over gets a warning, not a veto.
//
// ── ONE COMPUTATION, NOTHING STORED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The engine owns the season: `mistsAt(c, mists)` interpolates the front per
// side between keyframes (and holds it after the last), and `mistsHere(p, m)`
// says, for a point, whether it is behind the wall (`inWall`) and how far it
// stands from it (`wallM`). The fringe is `fringe_m` wide: a point not in the
// wall but nearer to it than `fringeM` is in the fringe. Clearings are the
// engine's own exceptions — `mistsHere` already counts them as clear ground.
// This module adds no season, no schedule and no law; it asks the engine.
//
// A mark is its FOOTPRINT, not its centre: its outline ring (or its extent
// box), the whole area inside it. Whether the WALL reaches it is whether that
// area leaves the clear ground; whether the FRINGE does is whether it leaves
// the ground standing at least `fringe_m` from the wall. At any crossing the
// engine's clear ground is exactly its clear box together with its clearing
// circles (`mistsAt`'s `clear` and `clearings`; `mistsHere` reads them so), and
// the ground `fringe_m` clear of the wall is the same box drawn in by fringe_m
// together with the same circles drawn in by fringe_m (mistsHere's `wallM` is
// the larger of the two distances). So both questions are one question —
// does a polygon lie inside a union of one box and some discs — and it is
// answered EXACTLY, not by sampling (Bevel's review: a wall slit narrower than
// any sample step, or a pocket of wall between clearings inside an outline,
// is a reach a sampler misses). See § coverage. Every reach found is then
// confirmed by the engine itself at a witness point inside the footprint; a
// disagreement is reported as unavailable, never as clear.
//
// Every answer is computed at the read from the record's schedule and the
// marks as they stand. No notice is kept, nothing is delivered, no mark moves.

// two neighbouring cuts no curve begins, ends or crosses another, so each
// piece of the polygon outside the union spans the whole strip — and one
// vertical line through the strip's middle meets it. On that line everything
// is intervals: the polygon's spans, the box's span, each disc's chord. The
// polygon is covered exactly when every span of it on every middle line lies
// inside the union of the clear spans. The wall is OPEN (the engine counts
// the box's edge and a disc's rim as clear), so a reach always has area, and
// area is never thinner than a strip's middle line. Floating point aside, this
// misses nothing; the witness is then put back to the engine to confirm.
