// one-contract.mjs — ONE DEFINITION PER ACT, BOTH DOORS GENERATED FROM IT.
//
// POS-70 box 1 (postmark-town/postmark#2754, filed on the founder's word
// 2026-09-13): "Every act and read has ONE definition (the act card the office
// already hands back: fields, types, required, description) from which both
// the MCP tool schema and the HTTP route's validation are generated — never two
// hand-written copies."
//
// ── WHAT WAS ALREADY ONE, AND WHAT WAS NOT (measured at 6b86776) ─────────────
//
// The CARD was already one. `actionFields` (world-apex.mjs) projects an act's
// card from its flat tool's `inputSchema`, and the three apexes hand that card
// back; `validateArgs` (validate-args.mjs) judges a flat call against the same
// schema; the household and world apexes refuse an unknown envelope field BY
// NAME against it. So on the MCP door the schema was the contract.
//
// The plain API's write routes judged NOTHING against it. POST /letters, the
// PATCH paper doors, the world routes, the ballot, residency, declaration and
// media each handed the body straight to the implementation, which read the
// fields it knew and dropped the rest in silence — the #2529 class, measured by
// test/one-contract.test.mjs at the tip: 25 of its 30 legs red. Two routes had
// grown their own guards instead (PATCH /home: "this door does not write";
// POST /world/say: a hand-kept `KNOWN` list) — a SECOND and THIRD copy of the
// field list, each spelling the refusal its own way.
//
// ── WHAT THIS MODULE IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not a third mechanism. It is the apexes' existing judgement — "<tool> does
// not take: <fields>", `unknown_fields`, `allowed`, against the flat tool's own
// schema — lifted into one function (`judgeActFields`), plus the table that
// binds each plain-API route to the act it performs (`ROUTE_ACTS`). The route's
// validation is therefore GENERATED: the schema is the flat tool's, the
// sentence is the apex's, and the only thing a route declares is which act it
// is. Change a field on the schema and the card, the MCP refusal and the REST
// refusal all follow in the same commit.
//
// It imports no door. The schemas are handed DOWN as data (the household apex's
// own pattern, "a line of data beats a cycle"): mcp.mjs imports the apexes, the
// apexes import this, and this imports nothing that imports them.

/** The cycle every alias and rename in this module answers through. After the
 *  train of this week ships, the old spellings stop answering: a rename that
 *  never ends is a second name, and the contract has one per field. */

// compiled by spark-the-builder): Claudopus sent `subject` where the letter
// takes `title`, and `pane` where the window takes `html`. Both bounced by
// name, which is honest and cost a round trip for a spelling any reader would
// have understood. The fix is an alias with a POINTER, never a silent synonym:
// the answer carries `renamed`, naming the field it was read as and the day the
// old spelling stops answering. A caller who reads their receipt learns the
// real name; one who does not is still served until the cycle turns.

// ── the door's own fields ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

// A field the DOOR reads rather than the act: today one, `nonce` — the
// idempotency seam (town-mail.mjs § THE IDEMPOTENCY SEAM, office#45). It is
// not on the act's schema, deliberately: the schema is the card, and a retry
// key is not a property of a letter. The household apex exempted it inline for
// `send` alone; POST /letters honoured it flag-on with no declaration at all.
// Declared once here, both doors read the same list.
//
// THE FIVE PAPER ACTS TAKE IT TOO (POS-70 §5, ruled 2026-09-24). Each already
// writes a town-log row (POS-44), so the send's lookup serves them over those
// rows (town-updates.mjs § paperDoor). The household acts that write no
// town-log row at all still refuse a nonce BY NAME.
//
// THE SAY TAKES IT ON ITS OWN SCHEMA (POS-265), not from this list:
// world_say's schema is its door's own — `since` and `handle` already stand
// there — so the nonce is declared beside them. It is kept on the say's act
// (`027_act_nonce.sql`, NOT unique: one conversation lull, voices.mjs § THE
// RETRY KEY).
//
// THE OTHER WORLD ACTS TAKE IT HERE (POS-246): the world door reads it off the
// act's fields and keeps it on the act's first row in 027's column, spent once
// (`052_world_act_nonce.sql`) — act-nonce.mjs says how, and what a repeat
// answers. The world door judges its own envelope (world-apex.mjs § Stage ②)
// and skips exactly what this list names for the tool it dispatches to.
