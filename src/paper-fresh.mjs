// paper-fresh.mjs — THE FRESHNESS LADDER, office half: the public reads of a
// resident's paper say which tense every field they hand back is in.
//
// The founder, 2026-08-23: "a unified thing where it's clear what's from the
// latest crossing/settlement versus what was JUST polled live", and of the
// middle rung, 2026-08-25: "the mushy middle *is* useful… let's not remove it".
// This module is the DATA half of that — the stamp that rides the answer. The
// site-wide visual encoding of settled ink versus live ink is a later wave and
// nothing here draws anything.
//
// ── THE THREE RUNGS, and what each one actually means ──────────────────────
//
//   settled  — the office's read index holds it. The index is rebuilt from a
//              town checkout by the rehydrate tick, and every response already
//              carries the commit it was built from (X-Postmark-As-Of), so
//              "settled" is a sha a reader can go and look at.
//   written  — the pen has committed it to the town record since that index was
//              built. True of every paper edit made through this office in the
//              window between the edit and the next tick.
//   pending  — the town log holds an un-drained row for it: the act is in the
//              office's own bookkeeping and the ferry has not settled it.
//
// A field is stamped with the highest rung that has something to say about it,
// and the answer carries the value from that rung.
//
// ── WHY `written` EXISTS AT ALL, WHICH IS THE FINDING THIS MODULE WAS BUILT ON
//
// The lane that produced this file was briefed as "the cutover made paper
// crossing-paced publicly; restore the pre-cutover default". The code does not
// say that, and neither does the box. The paper doors are DUAL-WRITE:
// `paperDoor` (town-updates.mjs) runs the door's own implementation
// unconditionally, so the pen commit and the push happen at the call whether
// TOWN_SINGLE_LOG is on or off; the journal row is a receipt for a drain that
// replays to the same bytes. town-bridge.mjs states it in its own words —
// "Paper acts replay to the same bytes and penCommit returns null for an empty
// diff". Only `send_letter` has a row-only variant (`sendLetterAsRow`), and
// letters are the class the crossing genuinely paces.
//
// So the crossing has never been what paces paper publicly, before the cutover
// or after it. What paces it is the REHYDRATE TICK — the office's read index.
// Nominally every fifteen minutes (deploy/postmark-office-rehydrate.timer,
// `*:07,22,37,52`); measured on the live box on 2026-08-25 at three hours and
// eighteen minutes behind the town tip. That gap is the whole latency a
// resident actually feels, and `written` is the rung that closes it: the office
// re-reads the file the pen wrote, from the same checkout the pen wrote it into,
// with the same parser the hydration uses.
//
// A compose built on the journal alone would have been byte-identical to the
// settled read on the live box today and for the whole flag-off era — a
// mechanism that can neither fail nor help. The journal half is still here and
// still correct, because it is what lights up on the day paper goes row-only;
// it is simply not what makes a resident's edit visible in minutes today.
//
// ── ONE READER, NEVER A SECOND RENDERER ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The VALUE always comes from the checkout, parsed by the same readers the
// hydration uses (vendor/tools/lib/town.mjs's `parseFrontmatter`, profiles.mjs,
// panes.mjs). It is never re-derived from a journal row's arguments. That is
// town-updates.mjs's own rule, kept: "There is no second renderer of an ADDRESS
// card here, so there is nothing that can drift from what the pen writes."
//
// The journal supplies the TENSE, not the text. Today a pending row and a
// written file always coincide, because the door writes both in one call — so
// the two rungs carry the same bytes and differ only in what the office admits
// about them. They would diverge the day a paper door becomes row-only, and on
// that day this module needs no new reader: the row is already the thing that
// says "not settled yet", and the checkout is already the thing that says what
// it says.
//
// ── THE STANDING GATE, and the law it appears to cross ─────────────────────
//
// A suspended handle gets NO overlay: their reads answer from the settled index
// and are stamped `settled`, truthfully, with the sha.
//
// standing.mjs opens with "READS ARE NEVER SUSPENDED", and this is not that.
// What is withheld is not a read — the record itself stays wholly readable, at
// the same sha, through this door and through the town repo, and a suspended
// resident keeps every page and every letter and above all the reason. What is
// withheld is the office's own COURTESY of publishing a claim ahead of the
// record. Under the dual-write shape there is nothing to withhold and the gate
// is a no-op; under a row-only paper door the overlay would be the sole
// publisher of a claim the audit has not seen, which is precisely what
// quarantine exists to hold. The gate is placed now, while it costs nothing,
// rather than remembered later, when it would be the whole point.
