// position-projection.mjs — WHERE EVERYONE STANDS, KEPT RATHER THAN RE-DERIVED
// (POS-264, "the office holds a crowd").
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `positions.mjs` answers "where is everyone" from the whole departure record,
// and every door that asks it pays for the record first: `departuresAcrossEras`
// reads the frozen walk ledger at main (a `git show`, plus the engine's
// materialise at the blessed ref) and the store's every departure act, on every
// call. Hearing asks it once PER VOICE. Measured on this tree
// (`tools/bench-hearing.mjs`, a room of 40, a fixture store of 2,400 acts): one
// `hear` took 28–52 s, ~1 s per voice, and every millisecond of it was reading
// the same record again. The answer itself — who stands where — is a hundred
// and thirty rows.
//
// So the office KEEPS the one thing the whole record reduces to: each
// resident's GOVERNING departure. That reduction is exact and it is the
// engine's own rule, not a summary of it — `walk.mjs § currentDeparture` takes
// the last record for a handle and nothing else, and `where-is.mjs § whereIs`
// reads nothing but that one record (and the fold, for anyone who never
// walked). A list holding only the governing record per handle, in the order
// each handle first appeared, therefore answers `everyonePlaced` byte for byte
// the way the whole record does. `test/position-projection.test.mjs` holds that
// as the EQUALITY FALSIFIER over a replayed sequence of acts.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// No fs, no git, no engine import, no store. The derivation stays where it is
// (`world.mjs § departuresAcrossEras`) and is handed in as `rebuild`; it is how
// this projection is born, how it is re-born when it ages out, and what the
// falsifier compares it against. Nothing in this file decides where anybody is.
//
// NO FRAME. The brief asked for one per entry, and the record cannot supply it:
// since POS-247 (2026-09-26) no walk record yields a frame, and
// `world-frames.mjs § foldFrames` answers the world frame for every fold. The one frame left is OCCUPANCY (the enter-exit record), written by the
// enter/exit and ride doors in `world-crossings.mjs` / `world-ride.mjs`, which
// this lane does not own. A frame field kept current by nothing would be a
// photograph, so it is absent until a writer there calls in.

// walkers poll placed them again, all at the same instant of the same town.

// moving cannot move until something is recorded, and a recorded walk moves the
// projection's epoch, which is part of the key. A walker who has arrived by the
