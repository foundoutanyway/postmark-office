// post-history.mjs — EVERY POST'S HISTORY, ONE READER (POS-547, generalized for POS-290).
//
// POS-547 gave the bug read its `history` (Darko, 2026-10-09: credit is the
// public record). This is that reader for every class: one acts query for the
// posts asked, kept to the acts that move a post's state, and one read of the
// signed stamp chain for what each post line paid. The rows are the class's
// own to shape, so each class keeps its mapper beside its law:
//
//   bug    bugs.mjs § bugHistoryOf     { stage, at, hand, credit, link, stamps_paid }
//   idea   ideas.mjs § ideaHistoryOf   { stage, at, hand, credit, link, note }
//                     § ideaAwardsOf   { label, to, stamps, hand, at, note, stamps_paid }
//   event, quest    § plainHistoryOf   { stage, at, hand }: posted, and closed
//
// ── THE CHAIN IS READ AS A DELTA ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// What a post line paid is on the store's `stamp_lines` (066), the town's
// signed chain: `MINT → <who> · N · for: post:<id>/<stage or label>`. POS-547
// read it with `canonical LIKE '%· for: post:%'`, a scan of the whole chain on
// every uncached read (Wright's review of #462). The chain is append-only by
// construction, and every writer takes the `stamp_lines` advisory lock before
// it reads the head and inserts head + 1 (stamp-lines.mjs § lockStampLinesVia;
// the one INSERT is insertStampRowsVia), so no lower seq can commit after a
// higher one. So each process keeps what it has read — the seq it reached, that
// row's seal, and the post lines' payments — and a read asks only for the rows
// past it: a primary-key range, nothing more. A store whose row at the
// remembered seq is gone or carries another seal (a restore, a test store) is a
// different chain, and the memo starts again from the top. Each office process
// (the main one, each read worker) keeps its own.
