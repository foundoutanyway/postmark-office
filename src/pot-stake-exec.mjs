// pot-stake-exec.mjs — one keeping stake, atomically, under the caller's flock.
//
// The sibling of stake-exec.mjs, and deliberately its twin: same subprocess
// shape, same flock, same pen, same one-JSON-line contract. A keeping stake is
// the ballot stake pointed at a funding pot, and the ledger's grammar has
// anticipated it since the seam landed — `pot/` is "reserved out of the ballot
// topic space like `world-mark/`" (stamp-mint.mjs's own words). What has been
// missing is a door.
//
// ONE PEN, ONE LAW, NEVER A SECOND WRITER. Every line this file appends is
// built by the TOWN's own builder (potStakeLine) and signed by the TOWN's own
// appendSigned, imported live from the checkout — the same discipline
// stake-exec keeps with clipApply. This process computes exactly one thing the
// town has no function for yet: the clip against liquid balance.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO HEADROOM CHECK, unlike a ballot stake: a ballot caps stamps
// per household per candidate, and a pot does not. D5's cap is on DOLLARS at
// intake ("intake refuses dollars past a pot's posted target … except pots
// explicitly marked uncapped") — a limit on the money rail, not the stamp one.
// Inventing a stamp cap here would be this door writing law.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, STAMP_KEY, TOWN_PUSH, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL, TOWN_TZ.
