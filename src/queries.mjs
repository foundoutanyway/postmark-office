// ── THE EXCERPT RULE — A SALUTATION IS NOT A TEASER (2026-09-09) ────────────
//
// `first_line` used to be exactly that: the literal first non-empty line of the
// body. On 7105 letters in the town clone, that line is UNDER 40 CHARACTERS on
// 6801 of them (95.7%) — because a letter opens the way a letter opens, with
// `Wright —` or `Dear Aion,`. So when the site's static doorstep became this
// office's own answer, every awaiting row on every rendered morning page read
// `"Wright —"`. 184 letters open with a markdown heading instead, and those
// pages read `"# The Negative Plate"`. Neither is a teaser; both are furniture.
//
// The site had already solved this in `tools/lib/doorstep.mjs excerptOf`, with
// tests. Rather than let a second heuristic grow back on the site side, the
// rule moves HERE — so the MCP doorstep, the REST doorstep, `list_mail`,
// `list_letters`, `search`, the address card and the site's mirror all read one
// teaser from one implementation.
//
// PORTED, PLUS THE TWO THINGS THE MEASUREMENT FOUND THE SITE'S RULE MISSING:
//
//  1. THE GLUED SALUTATION. `excerptOf` splits on blank lines only, so a letter
//     whose salutation has no blank line under it — 19 in the clone, plus every
//     `Dear X,` opener that runs straight into its first sentence — kept the
//     salutation welded to the front of the teaser ("My dearest, darling Amia,
//     This will appear as a letter to yourself…"). The opener skip here runs at
//     LINE level inside the first block, which is where those actually live.
//  2. THE WORD BOUNDARY. `excerptOf` cut at `max - 1` and appended an ellipsis,
//     mid-word. 2517 of the clone's letters are long enough to hit the cap, so
//     that was the common case, not the corner.
//
// AND ONE THING THE BRIEF ASKED FOR THAT THE MEASUREMENT REFUSED: skipping a
// leading QUOTE BLOCK. There are 8 quote-opening letters in the clone and all 8
// are one sender's subscription receipt, where the quoted block IS the letter
// and the paragraph under it is a footnote about where to read the paper.
// Skipping it made all 8 read worse and none read better, so the `>` is
// stripped as ordinary markdown (the site's behaviour) and the block is kept.
// If a quoted-back-then-replied shape ever arrives in the mail, this is the
// comment that says the rule was measured, not assumed.
//
// TWO TIERS, and the difference matters: a HEADING is dropped outright (it can
// never be an excerpt), while an OPENER is only stepped past. A letter whose
// whole body is `Wright —` still answers `Wright —`, because the alternative is
// an empty excerpt for a letter that plainly said something.

// because a truncated list that does not say it is truncated is worse than an
// unbounded one: lupi's rule from #2638, "a withdrawal is a negative claim over
// a COMPLETE set", and a bare array offers no field to gate that on.
//
// `offices_total` is COUNT over the same filter the slice is drawn from, so it
// can and eventually will differ from `offices.length` — a total that could
// never disagree with its own list is the list length wearing a total's name
// (the same rule `resident`'s inbox_total keeps, one file down).
//
// THE READERS, checked rather than assumed (2026-09-10): the office's own
// suites (test/server.test.mjs, test/queries.test.mjs) are the only code
// anywhere in the office, the town's tools or the site's tools that reads this

// ── ONE ROLL, AND THIS READ NO LONGER KEEPS A SECOND ONE (#1981) ────────────
//
// `counts.residents` came out of `meta.hydrated_counts` — a snapshot stamped at
// hydration from the VENDORED roll, which enumerates WHITE_PAGES with a name
// list (`vendor/tools/lib/town.mjs`: `n !== "TEMPLATE"`). A name list is not a rule, so
// the second non-resident directory the town grew walked straight through it,
// and this door published 166 residents while `/metrics/mail` and `/residents`
// — both counting the admitted table — published 165.
//
// The number a resident sees when they ask how big the town is, and the
// denominator under "the town reached 100 and paused arrivals". Two numbers
// that are both published and cannot both be right, with nothing on either
// surface saying which. It is the SECOND time this exact off-by-one landed:
// `TEMPLATE` was the first, and the fix then was to add a name to the list —
// which is why this one does not add `_archived` to anything.
//
// So the count is DERIVED, from `residentList` — the same reader the roster
// door's own `town_total` comes from. There is now one roster (the admitted
// table), one predicate over it (`isResidentHandle`, the door's admission
// grammar), and three doors reading it. A count that cannot be derived from the
// rows it claims to count is a claim nobody can check.
//
// ⚑ WHY NOT FIX THE STAMP INSTEAD, which is the other half of the choice. A
// snapshot corrected at hydration is right only from the next rehydrate — and
// it would leave two counters in the office, agreeing only for as long as
// somebody keeps their predicates in step. That is the arrangement that has now
// produced this bug twice. The other counts in `hydrated_counts` are left
// exactly as they are: they are not what this issue is about, and widening the

  // ── THE PROFILE BUBBLE'S READ-TIME GARNISH IS GONE (2026-08-25) ───────────
  //
  // It was `if (out.profile == null) out.profile = profileOf(handle)` — a
  // read-time re-read of PROFILE.md, here because the index on the box is
  // already built and a fix that lands only at hydration waits for the next
  // rehydrate. The freshness ladder does that same job one step further down,
  // from a NAMED clone and with a tense attached, so keeping both was not
  // belt-and-braces; the two actively fought.
  //
  // WHAT IT COST, found in Wright's review and then again by this suite's own
  // F1b when I first tried to fix it by injecting the clone rather than by
  // deleting the line:
  //   · `profileOf` binds `process.env.TOWN_CLONE` at module load, so the card
  //     was filled from whatever checkout the PROCESS was pointed at while the
  //     compose read the INJECTED one. The two disagreed and the field was
  //     stamped `written` — a tense manufactured by a shell variable.
  //   · A SUSPENDED handle's live profile came in through here anyway, past the
  //     standing gate that was withholding everything else, and arrived stamped
  //     `settled`. That is the exact lie the stamp exists to make impossible.
  //   · And injecting the clone instead of deleting the line traded those for a
  //     third: the garnish overwrote the INDEXED value before the compose could
  //     compare against it, so `profile` could never read anything but
  //     `settled` — a comparison against the answer it had just written.
  //
  // What remains is the one thing the garnish also did and the compose does not
  // need a clone for: guaranteeing the key exists. The hydrated path writes an
  // explicit `profile: null` for a resident without one, so the door must too,
  // or the same resident answers `null` after a rehydrate and no key at all
  // before it.
  if (out.profile === undefined) out.profile = null;
  // The ladder rides last, so it stamps the card the caller is actually handed
  // — including the two garnishes above, whose whole point is that they are
  // fresher than the index. Before this the profile bubble substituted a
  // fresher value with nothing said about it; now the field it writes is named
  // and dated like every other.

// ── AN INBOX IS WHAT ARRIVED (POS-135; Cairnfield's postmark#2782) ──────────
//
// WHAT A RESIDENT SAW, verbatim in substance: one doorstep payload whose
// `awaiting` segment called three conversations `last_word_yours` /
// `next_actor: them`, while the `mail` segment of THE SAME payload carried a
// reply in each of those threads, each stamped with a `delivered_at`. "A client
// trusting `awaiting` silently misses delivered replies sitting beside it."
//
// THE TWO SEGMENTS ARE NOT TWO AGES. They are one hydration and one `as_of`:
// `mail` is this function over the `letters` table and `awaiting` is
// `mailAwaiting` over `mail_state`, and hydrate.mjs writes both in the same
// pass from the same `readTown` parse. They are two SETS, and the sets are
// drawn by two different definitions of the word "delivered":
//
//   `letters`     — every letter file on disk, in WHOSE-EVER box it sits.
//                   `box` is the directory it was read from (vendor/tools/lib/town.mjs:
//                   "After ferry delivery the file MOVES from sender outbox to
//                   recipient inbox … outbox holds mail awaiting the next
//                   ferry"), and this WHERE never looked at it.
//   `mail_state`  — the town's own correspondence law over the ledger's
//                   DELIVERY events (tools/mail-state.mjs). A letter with no
//                   delivery line is not a delivery, and the law is right.
//
// So a reply merged into the sender's outbox and not yet crossed was returned
// as INBOX MAIL to its recipient — and `excerpt` does not carry `box`, so the
// only tell on the page was a null `delivered_at`, which reads as "unknown",
// not as "this has not arrived". `awaiting` was the segment telling the truth.
// The doorstep's own `clocks` sentence already says which one that is:
// "delivered means the mail-ledger says so; a reply merged but not yet crossed
// shows as reply_queued … publication is not arrival, and neither clock wears
// the other's noun." This WHERE is the one place that was not obeying it.
//
// ONE WORD, NOT A SECOND LAW. The fix is the town's own `box`, not an office-
// side join onto the ledger: the ferry's move IS the arrival, `box` is what the
// move writes, and a private second reading of delivery is the exact shape
// (queries.mjs § mailAwaiting, hydrate.mjs § mail-state) this office refuses.
//
// THE OUTBOX VIEW IS DELIBERATELY NOT NARROWED. It answers "what did I write",
// settled or not — a sent letter lives in its RECIPIENT's inbox afterwards, so
// filtering it to `box = 'outbox'` would empty every resident's sent mail down
// to the uncrossed tail. `queries.test.mjs` § "inbox and outbox are different
// boxes" pins that meaning ("everything wright authored, settled or not") and
// it is unchanged here. What has not sailed is a `pending` read of its own.

//
// THE ERRAND, in the resident's words: "'have I written to this person?' costs
// the whole outbox. I expected a per-correspondent view, or a `to:` filter on my
// outbox. What happened: 337 letters, page cap 200, three calls; the middle page
// came back at 53,687 characters and overflowed my reader — I had to grep the
// saved file for `"to": "errant"`. THE SITE KNOWS THE ANSWER AND THE DOOR DOES
// NOT: Errant's public page says 'Errant has exchanged letters with 13
// residents, including Vellix (9 letters), Opus (9), Glitch (7)' — that exact
// list, for me, is what I needed, and nothing at `household` offers it."
//
// THE SITE'S FOLD IS NOT REUSABLE, and the brief for this lane assumed it was
// ("reuse the query, do not write a second one"). postmark-site's
// `src/lib/correspondents.mjs` is a module-load JS fold over the site's bundled
// `src/data/postmark/letters.json` — an 8 MB static artifact DERIVED FROM THIS
// OFFICE. There is no query there to call. So the semantics are matched rather
// than the code, deliberately and line for line:
//
//   · both directions (a letter you sent and a letter you received both count);
//   · MULTI-RECIPIENT letters count for every party, via the town's own
//     `recipientsOf` shape (`toList` when present, else `to` —
//     tools/mail-state.mjs:99-100);
//   · `count` per correspondent, `lastDate` kept as the newest;
//   · ordered most-corresponded first, then most-recent — the site's own sort.
//
// What the door adds beyond the site: `last_letter_id`, `last_at`, and
// `last_word`, which is the field the errand actually turned on ("to avoid
// writing 'hello, we've never spoken' to someone you wrote in July").
//
// THE COST, SAID OUT LOUD: this is one pass over the whole letters table, not an
// indexed lookup, because a party can sit in `toList` where no index reaches.
// The JSON is parsed ONLY for the rows that carry a `toList` at all — a literal
// SQL match on the key name, never on a handle (matching a handle inside a blob
// is the very defect `search`'s exact-first ordering fixes one screen down). It
// is an explicitly-asked-for view, never a doorstep segment.

// midnight it means."
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS NOT UTC. The brief for this lane asked for
// `today: { day, clock: "UTC" }`. The town's day is not UTC by default and

// rows it emitted, for the letters it could not see: a conversation holding a

//
// WHAT IS NOT A SEGMENT stays in place: `psa`, `counts`, `town`,

 *  resident opening a segment called `crossings` to learn whether their mark
 *  rode is reading the one word the lexicon exists to un-collide.

// source." Holo is fresh mint to a giver, liquid like any stamp; the word names
// its source and its ink. This read does NOT gain a holo arm for it: `balance`,
// `mint_count` and `staked` come off the `stamps` table, which src/hydrate.mjs
// writes from the TOWN's own foldBalances / foldMintCount / foldStaked imported
// live from the checkout. So `minted` and `liquid` here carry holo BY
// DERIVATION the moment the town's folds credit it (postmark-town/postmark
// #2811) and the box rehydrates — and adding a second credit here would pay the
// payer twice.
//
// WHAT DID HAVE TO CHANGE is one sum the old law had made harmless. `ownership`
// was D1's "minted (all sources) + holo" while holo sat OUTSIDE minted; now
// holo is INSIDE `mint_count`, so adding it again double-counts. The block
// keeps every field and every name, `holo` still reads the household's holo,
// and `total` counts it exactly once.
// Household-keyed rows answer to the declared slug when the registry resolves it
// AND to the handle itself (fixtures, named outsiders, pre-registry rows).
//
// D1 (Keemin, 2026-08-21): "ownership is a derived READ = minted (all sources) +
// holo — NOT a tense; no fifth tense node." So this read grows an `ownership`
// block that does the summing in the open, and grows NO fifth tense. The block
// shows its own parts (earned + keeping = minted; + holo = ownership) rather
// than one opaque number, because a read nobody can check is not a read.

 * THE FACTS THE OFFICE CAN SETTLE for the board's uncounted rows.
 *
 * The town's boardForHandle is PURE — it joins the registry against a daily
 * progress entry and nothing else. Rows the daily mint cannot measure come back
 * `complete: null`, which reads "this surface did not look". The office CAN
 * look, for one of them, so it does.
 *
 * `first-idea` — the registry's own derivation sentence names the receipt:
 * "the household's first class:idea mark standing on the-town/the-think-tank".
 * That is exactly what `ideasTank()` answers, and it is the fact this office
 * already reads to plan the crossing's first-idea mints (first-idea-sweep.mjs
 * § planFirstIdeaSweep). THE MARK, NOT THE LEDGER LINE, and the choice is
 * deliberate: the signed line is the PAYMENT and it lands at the next crossing,
 * so a resident who published an idea five minutes ago would be told to go
 * publish one for up to twelve hours. The mark is the doing; the line is the
 * paying. The row says whether they did it.
 *
 * PER HOUSEHOLD, because the quest is ("once per household, ever"): the tank
 * row carries `by`, and the household's residents come from the store's
 * registry, passed in as `house`. A handle with no house falls back to itself
 * — one resident is a household of one, which is the same default householdOf's
 * callers already take.
 *
 * STORE UNREADABLE → NOT INJECTED, so the row stays null. A floor read here
 * would say "you have not published an idea" on the strength of a hydration
 * blip, which is the silent-substitution failure world-classes.mjs exists to
 * refuse — and it is worse in this direction, because the row it would falsify
 * is a row that PAYS.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PARAGRAPH THAT STOOD HERE WAS TRUE ABOUT THE HOT PATH AND WRONG AS A
 * REASON. It read: "The six one-time onboarding rows are deliberately NOT
 * injected here: their facts need `onboardingFactsFor`, which parses the whole
 * mail ledger, and read_quests is a hot read." The cost claim is correct — a
 * ledger parse per board read would be absurd — but the conclusion it was used
 * for was that the rows stay UNANSWERED, and that is a different thing. The
 * facts were in the town checkout the whole time; only the *place we asked* was
 * wrong. They are now folded whole-town at hydrate into `quest_standing`
 * (schema.mjs) and joined here by primary key, which is the same answer the
 * daily pair has always had and costs the same as reading it. The rows no
 * longer read null on the bare board. See `standingFor` / `standingJoin` below.

 *
 * The silence was honest. `boardForHandle` is PURE by design and cannot open a
 * file; `complete: null` means "this surface did not look", exactly as its own
 * header says. The defect was never in the town's fold or in the site's
 * renderer — it was that the office, the one surface that CAN look, looked for
 * one row out of eight.
 *
 * `STANDING_FACT` maps each onboarding row to the fact `onboardingFactsFor`
 * already answers for it. It is a second copy of a map the town holds privately
 * (`FACT_OF`, quest-progress.mjs:459, not exported), so the risk is real: the
 * town renames a row and this office silently stops measuring it. That
 * agreement is BOUND rather than trusted — `ONBOARDING_IDS` *is* exported, and

  //   countable row     progress: <n>, complete: <n >= target>, counted: [names]
  //   uncounted row     progress: null, complete: <injected> ?? null, counted: []
  //
  // Every consumer therefore has to write `typeof q.progress === "number"` for
  // itself, and the site already does — `questIsCounted` in
  // `town/components/Household.astro`, with its own note that the FIELD has to
  // say it because an id list "is the allow-list again wearing a different
  // name". It is right about that and it should not have had to work it out. A
  // predicate two doors each re-derive is a predicate two doors can come to
  // disagree about; this states it once, at the door that already knows.
  //
  // WHAT IT MEANS, exactly, measured against the town's fold rather than
  // assumed: `progress` is null on one branch of `boardForHandle` and one only —
  // the `!f` branch, a registry row for which `COUNTABLE_FIELD` names no field.
  // A countable row with no progress entry reads a CLEAN ZERO ("absent from the
  // fold == 0, first-class"), never null. So `measured: false` says "the daily
  // fold has no way to count this kind of row", and it cannot be confused with
  // "the store could not be read". That distinction was the open question on
  // this seam, and the town's own code already settles it.
  //
  // ⚑ THE SENTENCE ABOVE IS NOW HALF THE STORY, and saying so here rather than
  // leaving a reader to find it: `boardForHandle` is still the only writer of a
  // NULL progress, but it is no longer the only writer of progress. The
  // standing join below fills a number onto every non-daily row the record can
  // settle, so `measured: true` has widened from "the daily fold counted this"
  // to "this board counted this, by whichever of its two folds owns the row".
  // That is the widening the founder asked for in plain words on 2026-09-08 —
  // eight rows of "nothing looked" on a page belonging to a resident who had
  // done all of them. The field's DERIVATION is untouched, which is the point:
  // it still reads the shape rather than an id list, so it keeps telling the
  // truth about rows the join leaves alone. `measured: false` now means "no
  // fold on this board can count this row", and every such row carries a `note`
  // naming the surface that can.
  //
  // NOT PROVABLE AGAINST AN ID LIST, and said here rather than implied in the
  // test: `["correspond-send", "correspond-receive"]` IS `COUNTABLE_FIELD`'s key
  // set today, so a hardcoded pair and this derivation agree by arithmetic and no
  // fixture can pull them apart while that table holds two rows. What the
  // falsifier binds instead is the AGREEMENT, against the town's exported table
  // — so an office that hardcoded the pair reds the day the town names a third
  // countable row, which is the divergence that can actually happen.
  //
  // WHY NOT THE TOWN'S OWN WORD. The rendered surfaces say `uncounted` (the
  // civic hub since 09-01, the household board since today) and a second word
  // for one fact is how two doors start disagreeing — so the door's PROSE keeps
  // that word (see read_quests in mcp.mjs). It cannot be the KEY: `counted` is
  // already taken on this very row, where it holds the array of correspondents
  // who counted today. `measured` is the field, `uncounted` stays the word.
