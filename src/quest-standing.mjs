// quest-standing.mjs — the fold behind the board's non-daily rows.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, and it is a review finding rather than a design
// choice I got right the first time. This fold shipped inside `src/hydrate.mjs`,
// which is a SCRIPT — top-level await, `process.argv`, a `process.exit` on a bad
// town path — so nothing can import it and nothing in the office suite executes
// it. The one test that touches hydrate, `test/roll-handles.test.mjs`, reads it
// as TEXT and says so in its own comment. Eighty-nine lines carrying six rules
// were watched by nothing, and every one of them could be inverted without a
// red: the shared ledger parse, the first-each-way maps, the self-mail
// treatment, the `qualifies` filter, `since` as the EARLIEST crossing rather
// than the deepest, and the `depth: null` that tells an unsealed ladder apart
// from a resident who has earned nothing.
//
// So the rules live here, pure, and hydrate calls them. The town's own exported
// folds still produce every FACT — nothing here re-implements a town rule. What
// this file owns is the reduction from the town's per-pair, whole-ledger answers
// to the per-handle row the office indexes.

/**
 * The first delivery each way, per handle — the `since` for the two mail rows.
 *
 * SELF-MAIL COUNTS HERE, and that is a correction. The first cut skipped it,
 * borrowing the MINT's rule ("self-mail mints zero") for a CHECKLIST fact. The
 * town does not: `onboardingFactsFor` answers `sent: rows.some(d => d.from ===
 * handle)` with no self-check, and the registry's own derivation sentence for
 * `first-letter-out` says "at least one delivery whose sender is you". So a
 * resident whose only letter is to themselves read `complete: true` from the
 * town and `since: null` from this office — and then got a note saying the
 * record does not date a letter the ledger dates exactly. Two filters for one
 * fact is how two surfaces start disagreeing; the office follows the town.
 *
 * The ledger is in delivery order, so the first row seen for a handle is the
 * earliest — no sort, and no clock but the ledger's own dates.

/**
 * The whole block, from a town checkout: fold what the town folds ONCE, then
 * reduce. `tools` is the town's own module surface, injected so this stays
 * importable and so a falsifier can count the folds without a checkout.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO EXTRA FOLDS ARE HANDED DOWN, and it is a cost finding rather than
 * tidiness. `onboardingFactsFor(repo, handle, { deliveries })` answers its
 * `welcomed` fact from `households ?? currentHouseholds(repo)` and
 * `welcomed ?? welcomedHouseholds(repo, roll)` — so omitting the two arguments
 * makes ONE resident's boolean cost THREE parses of the 13k-line stamp ledger
 * (`currentHouseholds` parses it twice: once inside `householdKeys` →
 * `sealedRegistryDates`, once for its own `parseLaws`) plus a re-walk of every
 * WHITE_PAGES room reading every ADDRESS.md. Measured on the live town clone,
 * 182 residents: 548 ledger parses and ~43 s, against 5 parses and ~0.9 s with
 * the two folds passed, and all 182 rows byte-identical. The block's own
 * comment already guarded the deliveries parse against exactly this class; the
 * welcome row arrived on 2026-09-14 through the argument nobody passed.
 *
 * The count is CONSTANT, not one-per-rehydrate: `foldFriendships` parses the
 * ledger twice on its own and `currentHouseholds` twice more. What this rule
 * owns is that it does not grow with the resident count.
 *
 * A checkout too old to export `currentHouseholds` / `welcomedHouseholds`
 * leaves both `undefined`, which is exactly what `onboardingFactsFor` already
 * treats as "resolve your own" — the old behaviour, unchanged, not a fallback
 * added under a new road.
 *
 * `base` is the store's key base when the caller read one (POS-341 part 4,
 * src/mint-inputs.mjs § keyBaseVia): the town folds the roll and the
 * friendships from it in place of the printouts. Null is the printouts, as before.
