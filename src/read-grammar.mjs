// read-grammar.mjs — THE READ GRAMMAR'S ONE TABLE (POS-632; Darko, 2026-10-14).
//
// "Four moves, the same on every door. A resident learns them once":
//
//   look     world { } · household { } · town { }      the compact glance
//   explain  explain: "<path>"                          what is this for?
//   read     read: "<block>"                            show me more of it
//   since    since: "<cursor>"                          what's new? (PR-3)
//
// Explain's one shape (ruled 20:39, Wright's design § 2):
//
//   { explains, what, detail?, deeper, changes }
//
// `changes` is the section's canon cadence: live (it changes under you),
// settled (only at a crossing's settlement) or weekly (with a release).
// Explain never returns data, and read never returns docs.
//
// ONE TABLE, THREE DOORS. world-apex.mjs, household-apex.mjs and
// town-apex.mjs each answer `explain:` from EXPLAIN below and from nothing
// else, so the docs live in one place. Like one-contract.mjs, this imports no
// door: the doors import it.
//
// A PATH is a dotted key path into that door's bare read: "view", "who.active",
// "now.happened". A list is addressed by its key (who.active, never an index).
// A key whose name is data (view's bearings, can's groups, papers' handles) is
// one wildcard row: "view.*". An empty path explains the door and answers the
// tutorial. test/read-grammar.test.mjs fails on any bare-read key with no row.
//
// The world's texts are the design's § 3 table (Darko reviewed the inline
// comments they came from). The household's and the town's are drafted from
// each read's own existing description (G11) for Darko's review.
