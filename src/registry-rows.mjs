// registry-rows.mjs — THE ROUND TRIP, PURE (POS-187).
//
// The town's household registry is two JSON files in the town repo:
// `tools/households.json` (118 houses) and `tools/github-ids.json` (190 pins).
// POS-187 makes the STORE the record and the files a RENDERING of it. This
// module is the fold and the unfold, and nothing else — no database, no clock,
// no filesystem, no network. `tools/registry-seed.mjs` uses the fold,
// `tools/registry-drain.mjs` uses the unfold, and `src/registry-store.mjs`
// uses the unfold's object half.
//
// ── TWO RENDERINGS SINCE POS-394: THE PRIVATE ONE AND THE PUBLIC ONE ────────
//
// `renderRegistry` is the PRIVATE unfold: every column the store holds,
// `human` included. It is the round trip below, and it stays exact.
// `renderPublicRegistry` is what the drain PRINTS into the town repo, which
// is public: the same bytes with each house's private `human` KEY left out
// (src/registry-public.mjs; Darko 2026-10-05, Wright 2026-10-12). The store,
// the fold and the private render keep the name; only the printout drops it.
// So the town's files equal the PUBLIC render, and the private law below is
// proved against the fold, not against today's printout.
//
// ── THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS TO SATISFY ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//     renderRegistry(rowsFromRegistry(households, pins))  ===  the two files,
//                                                              byte for byte
//
// It is the gate on the whole flip. `registry-drain.mjs --check` runs it
// against the live clone and exits 1 naming the first differing line, and
// `test/registry-rows.test.mjs` runs it against the real 2026-09-22 fixtures.
// If it reds, the store is not the record yet and nothing may move onto it.
//
// ── WHY BYTE-EQUALITY IS REACHABLE AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Measured on the live files (2026-09-22, town origin/main df732534a): both are
// EXACTLY `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2) + "\n"` — the re-stringify of each
// parsed file is byte-equal to the file, LF throughout. So the whole problem
// reduces to rebuilding the same objects with the same KEY INSERTION ORDER, and
// two facts make that possible:
//
//   1. Every household's key order is a subsequence of one fixed template
//      (name, human, accounts, residents, since, member_of, declared_by) —
//      6 distinct live orderings, 0 mismatches over 118 rows.
//   2. Every pin's key order is a subsequence of one fixed template
//      (login, id, pinned, renamed, note, retired, renamed_to) —
//      7 distinct live orderings, 0 mismatches over 190 rows.
//
// So an ABSENT key and a key set to null are different things here, and this
// module keeps them different: a null column renders as NO KEY AT ALL. A house
// with no `name` is a house that has not said what it is called
// (src/residency.mjs § A HOUSE OF ONE — the card then reads
// "(unstated — ask them)"), and writing `"name": null` into the town's file
// would be both a lie and a diff.
//
// ── WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS STORED ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The HOUSEHOLD order is stored (`ord`). The file's 118 keys are in declaration
// order, which is neither sorted nor date-ordered — measured: `Object.keys()`
// differs from its own `.sort()`, and `since` runs backwards at 36 of the 118.
// Nothing derives that order, so it is a column.
//
// The PIN order is derived: the file is sorted by handle, and the town's own
// `serializePins` (residency.mjs:148) sorts on every write. A column for it
// would be a second answer to a settled question.
//
// ── ONE SERIALIZER, NOT A SECOND ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The bytes come from `serializeRegistry` and `serializePins` in
// `src/residency.mjs` — the town pen's OWN writers, the ones every join and
// every declaration already commit through. This module builds the objects; it
// does not spell JSON. If the pen's spelling ever moves, the drain moves with
// it in the same breath, because it is literally the same function.
//
// NOTE, FOR WHOEVER TOUCHES `serializePins` NEXT: there are two spellings of it
// in this repo today and only one sorts. `src/residency.mjs:148` sorts;
// `src/declare.mjs:455` does not, and `src/declare.mjs:411` is what the
// declaration ceremony commits through. The live file IS sorted, so the sorted
// spelling is the one that matches today's bytes and the one this module uses —
// but a declaration landing through declare.mjs's unsorted writer would append
// its new handle at the END of the file and `--check` would red on the next
// crossing. That divergence is older than this lane and is named in the PR
// rather than fixed in it.

import { serializeRegistry, serializePins } from "./residency.mjs";
import { publicRegistry } from "./registry-public.mjs";

// The two key templates, stated once. Every renderer below walks these in
// order and skips what the row does not carry; every reader above checks its
// input against them. They are the file's grammar, and they are the only place
// that grammar is written down.
//
// THE TAIL OF THIS TEMPLATE IS TWO COLUMNS THAT USUALLY RENDER NOTHING, and
// they are appended in the order their migrations landed so that no standing
// key ever moves: `formerly` (POS-158, migration 020) after `declared_by`, then
// `provisional` (POS-159, migration 021) after that. 0/118 live rows carry
// either — measured on the town's own files, twice, a day apart.
//
// Both are keys an ordinary value must NOT render, which is why `isAbsent`
// alone is not enough for this template. A house rendering `"formerly": []` or
// `"provisional": false` would diff, and 118 of them would rewrite the whole
// file on the first crossing. An empty alias list and a NULL are the same fact
// ("this house has no former key"); so are a `false` and an absent
// `provisional` ("this house's key was chosen"). Both render as no key at all,
// exactly as a NULL `name` does — see the two narrow predicates below.
export const HOUSEHOLD_KEYS = Object.freeze([
  "name", "human", "accounts", "residents", "since", "member_of", "declared_by", "formerly",

  "login", "id", "pinned", "renamed", "note", "retired", "renamed_to",
]);

// ── THE THIRD TEMPLATE, AND THE ONE THE STORE ACTUALLY FORCED ───────────────
//
// The two templates above order the keys of a HOUSE and of a PIN, both of which
// are built here out of named columns, so their order was never in doubt. An
// ACCOUNT is different: `households.accounts` is a `jsonb` column, and Postgres
// `jsonb` is not an object — it is a SORTED MAP. On the way in, every object's
// keys are reordered by LENGTH IN BYTES, then bytewise, and they come back out
// that way forever. Insertion order is not stored and is not recoverable from
// the column (`src/state-log-from-store.mjs § the three things` names the same
// property for `acts.payload`).
//
// `login` is 5 bytes and `id` is 2, so the store hands every account back as
// `{ id, login }` while the town's file spells it `{ "login", "id" }`. MEASURED
// ON A REAL POSTGRES (dev sandbox, 2026-09-22 19:07 EDT, after
// `registry-seed.mjs --apply`): `registry-drain.mjs --check` red with
// `tools/households.json differs at line 9 — store renders "id": 306985727, /
// the clone has "login": "vertas-marginalia",`. 121 accounts, so 121 blocks of
// the file, on the first crossing.
//
// So the render orders nested keys BY THIS TEMPLATE, never by the order the row
// arrived in. That restoration is legitimate here for the reason
// `state-log-from-store.mjs` gives for `witnesses` and refuses for `payload`:
// the shape is FIXED — 019's own header measured it, `login` 121/121 and `id`
// 121/121, exactly two keys, always both — and `accountMatches` reads
// `a.id`/`a.login` by name. An arbitrary payload has no such template and this
// file invents none.
export const ACCOUNT_KEYS = Object.freeze(["login", "id"]);

// Which household columns carry nested objects, and the template each one's
// objects are ordered by. `accounts` is the only one: `residents` and
// `formerly` are `text[]` of strings (no keys to reorder) and every other
// column is a scalar. If a later migration adds a second jsonb column, it
// arrives with its row here in the same commit, or the drain renders it in
// Postgres's order and reds on the first crossing.
//
// `home_images` (migration 050, POS-219) is the second jsonb column, and it is
// an OBJECT keyed by handle with no fixed template: its empty template renders
// every handle SORTED (`orderNested`'s tail), so the file's order never depends
// on the (length, bytes) order jsonb hands the keys back in.
const NESTED_KEYS = Object.freeze({ accounts: ACCOUNT_KEYS, home_images: Object.freeze([]) });

// A pin's column names are the file's key names except one: `id` is a reserved
// enough word in SQL company that the column is `gh_id`, and this is the single
// place the two spellings meet.

  login: "login", id: "gh_id", pinned: "pinned",
  renamed: "renamed", note: "note", retired: "retired", renamed_to: "renamed_to",

const isAbsent = (v) => v === undefined || v === null;

// THE SECOND ABSENCE, and it belongs to exactly one column. `formerly` is
// `text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`, so the store never hands back a NULL for it —
// it hands back `[]`, which `isAbsent` would happily render as a present empty
// key on all 118 houses. An empty alias list is not a value the file has ever
// carried, so it renders as nothing. Named as its own predicate rather than
// folded into `isAbsent` because widening `isAbsent` would also silence an
// empty `residents` or `accounts`, and a house with no residents IS a diff
// somebody needs to see.
const EMPTY_LIST_KEYS = new Set(["formerly"]);

// THE THIRD ABSENCE, and it belongs to exactly one column too. `provisional`
// (migration 021, POS-159) is `boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`, and it is TRUE
// only while nobody has chosen the house's key. 0/118 live rows carry it —
// measured 2026-09-22 — so `"provisional": false` on every house would rewrite
// the whole file on the first crossing, exactly as `"formerly": []` would.
//
// It gets its OWN predicate rather than joining `EMPTY_LIST_KEYS` because the
// two rules are different shapes: an empty array and a false are only alike if
// you squint at them through JavaScript's truthiness, and a `rendersAsAbsent`
// that dropped every falsy value would also silence `"since": ""` and a pin id
// of 0. Named narrowly, it can only ever do this one thing.
const FALSE_IS_ABSENT_KEYS = new Set(["provisional"]);

// THE FOURTH ABSENCE (migration 050, POS-219). `home_images` is `jsonb NOT NULL
// DEFAULT '{}'`, and a house whose residents have uploaded no picture holds
// `{}`. Rendered, that is `"home_images": {}` on every such house and a whole
// file rewritten on the first crossing, so an empty map renders as no key, by
// the same narrow rule as the two above.
const EMPTY_MAP_KEYS = new Set(["home_images"]);
