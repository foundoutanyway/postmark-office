// registry-store.mjs — the household registry, READ FROM THE STORE (POS-187).
//
// `src/registry-rows.mjs` is the pure round trip. This file is the half that
// touches Postgres: it reads `households`, `household_pins` and
// `registry_meta` through the office's ONE pool (`world2-acts.mjs actsQuery`,
// `WORLD2_PG_URL`, role `office_api`) and hands back exactly the shapes the
// registry's readers already hold —
//
//     { schema_version, note, households: { <slug>: { … } } }     the registry
//     { <handle>: { login, id, … } }                              the pins
//
// so a caller can feed the result straight to `houseForAccount`,
// `houseForName`, `conformance` or `planRegistryJoin` with nothing in between.
// That is deliberate: the store read is not a new vocabulary, it is the SAME
// object arriving by a different road, and the round-trip falsifier is what
// makes "the same object" a measured claim rather than a hope.
//
// ── NULL IS NOT EMPTY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `actsQuery` answers `null` — never `[]` — when the office is not pointed at
// the record, and this module keeps that distinction all the way up.
// `loadRegistryRows()` returns `null` for "I could not look" and a rows object
// for "I looked". A registry read that turned "I could not look" into "the town
// has no households" would hand `planRegistryJoin` an empty registry, and an
// empty registry is a registry in which every account is unknown and every
// house is available — which mints duplicates over live rows. Every caller
// branches on null: the doors refuse on it (src/declare.mjs § readRegisters,
// src/residency.mjs § requestResidency), and so do the ceremonies.
//
// The store is the registry's one writer (src/ceremony.mjs); the town's
// tools/households.json and tools/github-ids.json are printed from it by
// tools/registry-drain.mjs.

// nothing derives it (measured 2026-09-22: not sorted, and `since` runs
// backwards at 36 of them), so the column is the only place that order lives
// and a query without this clause would make the town's file depend on the
// planner's mood.
//
// `formerly` (migration 020, POS-158) and `provisional` (migration 021,
// POS-159) are selected like any other column and carried through untouched.
// `node-postgres` hands a `text[]` back as a JS array of strings and a `boolean`
// back as a JS boolean, which is exactly what `registryFromRows` wants — and its
// renderer drops each key at its own default (an empty array, a false), which
// today is all 118 rows for both.

//
// `tools/households.json` opens `schema_version`, then `note`, then
// `households`. `registryFromRows` emits the meta keys in the order it receives
// them, so this list is what decides the file's first bytes. It is STATED
// rather than stored, for the reason `loadRegistryRows`'s doc gives: two keys,
// and a column holding their order would be a column nobody could read.
//
// NOT ALPHABETICAL, and that is the whole point — `note` sorts before
// `schema_version`, so an `ORDER BY key` would spell the file's first two lines
// the wrong way round on every crossing.
const META_KEYS = Object.freeze(["schema_version", "note"]);

// ── AND THE QUERY ORDERS BY IT, RATHER THAN BY THE PLANNER'S MOOD ───────────
//
// `foldRegistryRows` already puts the two keys above back in the file's order,
// so the bytes the town has today were never at risk. WHAT WAS: any meta key
// BEYOND those two. The fold appends such a key in the order the rows arrived,
// and `SELECT key, value FROM registry_meta` with no ORDER BY hands them back
// in whatever order the planner liked that morning. MEASURED: the same two
// extra keys arriving two ways render `…,note,zeta,alpha,households` and
// `…,note,alpha,zeta,households` — two different files from one store.
//
// So the tail is ordered by `key`, which is a real order rather than an absent
// one, and the head is ordered by the list above EXPLICITLY. Both halves are
// built from `META_KEYS`, so the SQL and the fold cannot drift apart: there is
// one order here and two readers of it, not two orders.
//
// Its siblings `HOUSEHOLDS_SQL` and `PINS_SQL` both order deliberately, for the
// reason 019's header states — a SELECT with no ORDER BY returns whatever the
// planner liked and the file's bytes would then depend on the weather. This one
// was the exception and is no longer.

// in the town's file, and a rename that re-derived one would move the house to
// the end and rewrite every row after it — 118 lines of diff for one house
// stating its name. The UPDATE names no `ord` at all, so the column keeps what
// it holds and the file changes exactly one key.
//
// `household_pins` IS NOT TOUCHED, and that is a fact about the schema rather
// than an omission: a pin row carries `handle`, `login`, `gh_id` and four
// legacy notes (019) and NO household reference of any kind. The belonging
// lives in `households.residents`, which is a column of the row being renamed
// and therefore travels with it. Nothing in the pin table knows a slug, so
// nothing in it can be left pointing at an old one.

// slug; a rename whose source has moved under it updates nothing and answers
// `null` rather than reporting success over a row it never found.
