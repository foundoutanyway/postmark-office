 * Does one registry `accounts[]` entry name this caller?

 *
 * The old shape was `id === actorId || login === actorLogin` — an OR, not a
 * fallback, so a login match alone was sufficient EVEN WHEN both sides carried
 * ids that disagreed. **GitHub releases abandoned logins for re-registration.**
 * A stranger who claims a resident's old login therefore satisfied the login
 * half against a row that still listed that string, and was treated as the
 * account's owner. `tools/pin-github-ids.mjs` names this exact risk, and the
 * town's own `tools/witness.mjs § loadBindings` already states the law — *"a
 * pinned resident is deliberately NOT login-matchable: their old login may have
 * been abandoned and re-registered by a stranger, and their ADDRESS `github:`
 * string is display-only."* This is that law, applied at the places that decide.
 *
 * The row's pinned-ness is what decides, not the caller's: if the ROW carries an
 * id, only an id can match it. That is deliberate and slightly stricter than
 * "compare ids when both have them" — a caller with no verified id must not
 * reach a pinned account by naming it, which is precisely the recycled-login
 * attack. A legacy row with a login and no id keeps matching by login, so
 * nothing pinned breaks and nothing unpinned regresses.
 *
 * Vendored deliberately: the town repo carries the identical rule in
 * `tools/account-match.mjs`, and the two must move together. If this changes,
 * that changes in the same round.

// The `UNREADABLE` distinction is KEPT: the store answers `null` for "this
// office is not pointed at the record", and since admission became the bind
// (Keemin, 2026-09-29) that is a refusal — a door that cannot read the record
