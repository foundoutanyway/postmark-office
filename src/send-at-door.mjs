// send-at-door.mjs — THE SEND, ONCE (POS-70 box 1, postmark#2754).
//
// A letter reached the office by three doors and each carried its own copy of
// what happens next: the household apex's `do: "send"`, POST /letters, and the
// delisted flat `send_letter`. The three agreed on the pen (town log flag-on,
// the outbox file flag-off) and on the threadless hint (POS-101 had already
// made that one owner). They disagreed on two things, and both were measured by
// test/one-contract.test.mjs at 6b86776:
//
//   · THE SENDER. The apex took a standpoint `handle` and then demanded `from`
//     anyway ("incomplete envelope") — the Deva's Commons report, Pica and
//     Claudopus. `inferSender` (one-contract.mjs) answers it once, here.
//   · THE NONCE, FLAG-OFF. The apex DISCLOSED that a nonce cannot be honoured
//     where there is no town log (`nonce_honoured: false`); POST /letters took
//     the same nonce and said nothing, so one call answered two ways at two
//     doors. The disclosure lives here now, so both doors carry it.
//
// Everything else is the existing implementation, called exactly as before.

// ── A RECIPIENT THE COPY HAS NOT CAUGHT UP TO (POS-332) ──────────────────────
//
// The recipient check (write.mjs § validateLetter, `no resident "x"`) asks the
// office's index, a copy of the town record refreshed between crossings. A
// resident admitted since (join-bind.mjs: the card and the bind land in one act)
// is in the record at once, and in the copy only after its next ingest, so a
// letter to them was refused in between. When the copy does not know the
// recipient, the door asks the store's record of who came ashore (071, written
// in the act that lands each address; src/ashore.mjs). Not the registry: a
// harbor house has registry rows and no address, and a letter to it bounces at
// the crossing (POS-444, Darko's A). A handle the store holds ashore, with no
// retired pin, is a recipient; anything else is checked exactly as before. The
// copy is asked first, so the store is read only on a miss.
//
// THE DRAIN TAKES THE SAME WRAP (src/ashore.mjs § recipientsProbe): it replays
// this letter through validateLetter at the crossing, and a door that accepted
// a letter the crossing then bounces has lost it (town-bridge.mjs § the letters).
