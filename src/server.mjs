// one silently drops a whole derived block where its twin has an answer. Behind
// nginx that is a pool member serving quietly wrong readings to a share of the
// town, and nothing in the answer says so.
//
// ⚑ THE SYMPTOM THAT DROVE THIS GUARD HAS MOVED, AND THE GUARD HAS NOT.
// `stands` was the block measured going dark, and POS-162 moved it off this
// store onto `acts` — so a worker pointed at a missing `dynamic.db` now answers
// `stands` correctly and drops OTHER readings instead (world-hold.mjs §
// readHoldEffects' hold events, the apex's held-things and arena reads). The
// rule this guard states is unchanged and so is its exit code; only the example
// is restated, because a guard whose named symptom has stopped being true reads
// as a guard nobody has checked.
//
// So the guard goes UPSTREAM, at boot, beside the key store's — because the
// distinction that matters is not "is the store there" but WHOSE MISTAKE ITS
// ABSENCE IS. Absent at a read, mid-flight, is the world's news and the reader
// reports it. Absent at boot, when an operator named the path, is the
// operator's, and a process that cannot see the store it was pointed at must
// not take traffic. Same rule as `oauth.db` directly above; same exit code.
// ⚑ THE READERS' OWN FUNCTION, NOT A SECOND COPY OF THE RULE (reviewer's
// repair B, lap 5). This line was `process.env.WORLD_DYNAMIC_DB ?? resolve(ROOT,
// "dynamic.db")` — the same rule as `dynamicDbPath()` spelled a second time from
// a different root (`ROOT` here is `resolve(HERE, "..")`; the readers' is
// `OFFICE_ROOT`, `resolve(import.meta.dirname, "..")` in world-store.mjs). They
// resolve to the same string today, which is exactly what makes a second copy
// dangerous: it agrees until it doesn't, and the failure it produces is a guard

// wrong file while the workers serve a null block. A guard must ask the
// question in the words of the thing it guards.

// of asking for their own key for an hour. That bites hardest exactly where

// agent usually runs on. The claim desk also carries a tighter cap of its own
// for its own abuse case (one live ask per handle, a day long) than any IP
// bucket gives it.
//
// Disclosed, because it is the honest order of events: the lane's own standing
// falsifier is what hit the shared cap, and I separated the buckets only after
// deciding the separation stands on the reasoning above. A test is a reason to
// look; it is not a reason to change what a door does.
//
// AND IT COUNTS MINTS, NOT ATTEMPTS. The berth shape this is modelled on
// records a hit the moment it is asked, before it knows whether anything will
// be minted — so a refusal costs the caller a slot for a key they did not get.
// On that door every refusal after the check is a name collision, and charging
// for it is nearly harmless. On this one the refusals are a typo'd handle, a
// handle the roll does not keep, an ask already standing, and a quarantine —
// four ways to be told no while minting nothing, and a resident who mistypes
// their own address three times should not lose their afternoon over it. So

// error carries: pg's SQLSTATE ("57P01" when a restart ends the session), Node's
// "ECONNRESET", store-pool's "store-acquire-timeout". writeHead threw on those,
// inside an async handler, and the body-read catch beside it answered 400 "could
// not read the body". So the code is classified once, here, where every REST
// answer is written, rather than at each catch:
//
//   · an integer from 100 to 599 is a status, and passes through untouched;
//   · a code that says the store is gone (store-pool.mjs § isStoreLostCode) is

//
// AND THE TOWN INDEX'S 503 SAYS WHEN TO ASK AGAIN. Its refusal (index-probe.mjs §
// UNREACHABLE_DEFECT, from the doors and the write path's probe alike) says "ask
// again shortly"; it now carries Retry-After as the bearer check's 503 does.
// STORE_LOST, READ_RETRY, ACT_RETRY and FAULT_LOGGED (the office's own words for
