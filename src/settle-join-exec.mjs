// settle-join-exec.mjs — the town-writing half of settle-join (#3231).
//
// Invoked by `settleJoinAtOffice` as a subprocess under the town lock (on the
// box: `flock -w 30 town.lock`, the lane `src/declare-exec.mjs` takes), so a
// settlement never races a crossing or a declaration. It pulls the clone,
// re-checks everything against the record and the fresh clone, and runs the
// ceremony; the settle makes the one pen commit (the printed registers and the
// house's key lines, src/house-key.mjs). Prints one JSON line.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ.
// argv[2]: JSON { handle, ghId, ghLogin, pr, road, cardLogin } — the join the door read back.
//
// Exit 0 with the answer or { error: { code, defect, hint } } (a refusal is an
// answer); exit 1 only when the machinery itself trips.
