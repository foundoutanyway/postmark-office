// stake-exec.mjs — one stake, atomically, under the caller's flock.
//
// Invoked by votes.mjs as a subprocess (on the box: wrapped in
// `flock -w 30 town.lock`, the same lock the ferry chain holds — a stake
// append can never race a crossing). Does the whole critical section in one
// process: pull the clone, then the stake as src/ballots-store.mjs §
// stakeInStore orders it — the ballot post and its votes read in one store
// transaction, the town engine's clip, the vote act and its response, the
// sealed ledger lines committed and pushed with the pen's ceremony, and the
// store committed last (POS-349). Prints exactly one JSON line.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, STAMP_KEY (path to the pen's ed25519 pem), TOWN_PUSH=1,
//      BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ, and the office's store
//      (WORLD2_PG / WORLD2_PG_URL, the pen's own).
// argv[2]: JSON { handle, topic, candidate, n, via, date }.
//
// Exit 0 with {applied,...} or {error:{code,defect,hint}} (a bounce is an
// answer); exit 1 only when the machinery itself trips.
