// static-keys-retire.mjs — retire ONE hand-issued static key, by household and
// handle, and keep the import from bringing it back (POS-604).
//
// Until now removing a static key was hand SQL, and nothing recorded that it had
// happened: `importStaticKeys` saw a missing row and wrote it again from
// OFFICE_KEYS (static-keys.mjs § importStaticKeys). A retirement is now a ROW:
// the `static` row is deleted and a `retired` row takes its place in the same
// table (`oauth_tokens`, no migration, no grant change: office_api already holds
// SELECT, INSERT and DELETE, and nothing here UPDATEs). The tombstone keeps the
// retired row's token_hash (so the import can refuse that hash) and its nonsecret
// selector metadata: household, handles, gh_id. Every bearer reader filters on
// its own kind, so a `retired` row resolves nothing, and the sweep
// (`DELETE ... WHERE expires < now`) never reaches it: its expires is NULL.
//
// ── NO KEY, NO HASH, IN OR OUT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The operator names a household and a handle. The tool finds the row; it is
// never handed a key or a hash and it never prints one. Dry runs and receipts
// say counts, households, handles and the KIND of cover found. A hash is held in
// memory between the DELETE's RETURNING and the tombstone INSERT and the mirror.
//
// ── THE STORE FIRST: ONE TRANSACTION, UNDER A TABLE LOCK ────────────────────
//
//   1. SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s', then LOCK TABLE oauth_tokens IN SHARE ROW
//      EXCLUSIVE MODE (Wright, POS-604, 2026-10-12). That mode blocks every
//      other WRITER of the table (a mint, a rotation, the sweep, an import, a
//      hand DELETE) and lets READERS through, so bearer lookups keep answering.
//      office_api may take it: the mode needs UPDATE, DELETE or TRUNCATE on the
//      table and office_api holds DELETE (031). No grant, no migration. SELECT
//      ... FOR UPDATE would need UPDATE, which office_api does not hold. If the
//      lock is not granted within 2s the transaction rolls back and the result
//      is `busy`: nothing changed, run it again.
//   2. only AFTER the lock: read the registry (registryRowsVia, the canonical
//      SQL and fold in THIS transaction) and the household's static rows and the
//      human household keys of the account the registry pins this handle to;
//   3. prove the selector is still exactly one row and that ANOTHER working key
//      still covers THIS household AND handle (below). Unproved, unreadable, or
//      the count changed since the dry run: ROLLBACK;
//   4. the counted DELETE (a CTE; it must delete exactly one row), then the
//      tombstone INSERT, two statements, one transaction.
//
// Once the lock is held, SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '5s': no statement may hold
// the table longer than that; one that does is cancelled, the transaction rolls
// back and the result says so (nothing written).
//
// THE TOMBSTONE KEEPS THE KEY'S OWN `created` (when it was imported), not the
// moment it was retired: the row still describes the key. The retirement's own
// instant is in the result (`retired_at`), not stored; storing it would need a
// column, and this change adds none.
//
// NOTHING BUT THE DATABASE HAPPENS WHILE THE TABLE IS LOCKED: no file, no
// mirror, no network. The result reports `lock_held_ms`, the time from the lock
// being granted to the COMMIT's acknowledgment, so a run can say what it cost.
//
// A COMMIT whose acknowledgment never arrives is reported as exactly that
// (`commit_unknown`): the store may or may not hold the retirement, and the tool
// says so rather than claiming either.
//
// ── THE COVER, FAIL CLOSED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Retiring the last working key for a household/handle would lock it out, so one
// other key must stand. A cover is either
//   · another `static` row of the SAME household whose handles include the
//     handle (static rows do not expire), or
//   · a live `household` key (expires >= now) of the account the registry pins
//     this handle to, where the registry also proves that account belongs to
//     THIS household and the handle is its resident, held EITHER in the human's
//     hand (held_by IS NULL) OR in a resident's own hand whose claimed_handle is
//     EXACTLY this handle (oauth.mjs § mintHouseholdKey's custody grain; Wright,
//     POS-604, 2026-10-12). A resident key claimed for another handle, or with no
//     claimed handle, is not a cover.
//     Pinned to the account alone is not enough, and nothing here falls back to
//     the login index householdFor adds at request time: a cover that only that
//     fallback would resolve is refused. Fail closed.
// A static household string that is not a registry slug can be covered only by
// another static row.
//
// ── THE FILE, SECOND, EXPLICITLY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The mirror (paperwork.mjs ⚑ THE MIRROR IS TEMPORARY) is the rollback's bridge:
// a file that still holds the live static row would let a rolled-back office let
// the retired key back in. So the retirement is replayed into the file here, in
// the tool's own sqlite transaction with sqlite statements, and READ BACK. A
// file that is missing, a write that fails, or a read-back that differs is NOT a
// success: the result says the store committed and the file is not verified, and
// names the command that repairs it (`--mirror-only`). When the mirror is deleted
// with oauth.db, this step goes in the same change.
//
// `--mirror-only` reads the recorded tombstones for the household and handle and
// replays them into the file. It writes and deletes NOTHING in the store, never
// selects a `static` row (a fresh key for the same household and handle, added
// since, is counted and left alone), and refuses when no tombstone is recorded.
