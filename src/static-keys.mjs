// static-keys.mjs — the office's static keys, in the store (POS-352 part 2).
//
// A static key is a bearer key an OPERATOR issued by hand, not one a human
// minted at the key desk: the founder's own household key, the Bug Catcher's,
// and the keys the Meeps Come Home moves will add. Until this file they lived
// in one env var, `OFFICE_KEYS`, which the office parsed at boot:
//
//   <key>=<household>[#<gh_id>]:<handle>[,<handle>...][;<key>=...]
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-06, 2a): static office keys become a `static` kind
// with an explicit handles column and an explicit household column, imported
// from OFFICE_KEYS by hash, nothing re-issued, no token printed. So a static
// key is now a row in the tokens table (`oauth_tokens` in the store, 031 and
// 070), and the env var is read only by the import (tools/static-keys-import.mjs).
//
// ── WHY THE COLUMNS ARE EXPLICIT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A minted household key resolves its handles by gh_id: every handle pinned to
// that account (oauth.mjs § householdFor). A static row does NOT. It names its
// household and its handles itself, exactly as the env row did, so a row that
// holds two handles out of a house (a Meep's key on the founder's account)
// stays two handles. Re-minting such a row as a household key would widen it to
// the whole house; the explicit columns are what keep it the size it was.
//
// ── THE gh_id, AND WHAT IT IS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A static key's household is a string an operator chose. There is no GitHub
// sign-in behind it and therefore no verified account id, which is fine for
// everything these keys have ever done and NOT fine for holding a role: the
// role registry keys on the immutable gh_id (src/roles.mjs). So the household
// field may carry a pinned id, `keemin#583231`. Founder-ruled shape
// (2026-08-26): a static key resolves for role purposes ONLY if its row carries
// an explicit gh_id. Without one the key works exactly as it always has and
// simply holds no roles. The row keeps that: `gh_id` is set only when the env
// row had one.
//
// ── THE RESOLUTION IS THE ONE IT ALWAYS WAS ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `staticLookup` answers `{ household, handles: Set, ghId? }`, the object the
// boot parse put in its map, field for field: no login, no key kind, no harbor
// stamp, no expiry. Everything downstream (identityOf's key_kind, the role
// gate, the key desk's `key.ghId` gate) reads the same object it read before.
// test/static-keys.test.mjs pins it against the old parse for every shape.
//
// ── NOTHING SECRET LEAVES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A row holds sha256(key), base64url, as every other token row does; the key
// itself is never stored. Nothing here returns or prints a key or any part of
// its hash: the import reports counts and household names only.
