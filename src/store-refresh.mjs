// store-refresh.mjs — the poll's store read: one in flight, and never forever.
//
// ONE STORE READ IN FLIGHT (POS-639). The office's poll used to start a roll
// and a probe read every RELOAD_POLL_MS whether the last pair had answered or
// not. On a loaded machine they piled up, and an older read finishing after a
// newer one put the older index back. A tick that finds the last pair still
// reading skips.
//
// THE BOUND IS POSTGRES'S, AND THE GUARD WAITS FOR IT (the reviews of office#591
// and #595). The pen pool sets no statement timeout, so a read that hung would
// have held the guard for good. #595's first answer, a JS race that freed the
// guard at the bound, freed the guard and NOT the connection: the next tick took
// a third connection and queued for a fourth, and the pen pool is three per
// thread (world2-pen.mjs § pool), shared with every resident read and write.
// The poll would have held the whole pen, and residents met StoreAcquireTimeout.
// So the bound rides each read itself: the poll's two reads run with
// statement_timeout = STORE_READ_BOUND_MS (server.mjs), Postgres cancels a read
// that runs past it, and the guard is freed only when the read has SETTLED. The
// poll therefore holds at most the pair's two connections. The JS timer here
// only names the moment the bound passed, in the journal. The bound is PER
// STATEMENT, so a healthy probe of several statements may run past it in all.
