// store-writedown.mjs — the store's write-down, in the drain's place (G1 lane 3).
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT ────────────────────────────
//
// G1 makes the store the only source. The chain that crosses the town used to
// read household sketchbook branches that the drain had filled from the sqlite
// journal, which was itself a copy of what the store already held:
//
//     store  ->  journal copy  ->  drain  ->  draft/<household>  ->  sweep  ->  fold
//
// Two lossy hops, and the five acts with no journal twin on 2026-09-06 are what
// a lossy hop looks like from the outside: the fold could not see them because a
// COPY failed, not because the store lacked them.
//
// This module removes both hops and nothing else:
//
//     store  ->  draft/<household> (local, never pushed)  ->  sweep  ->  fold
//
// THE FOLD ITSELF IS NOT TOUCHED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. The grammar that
// decides what publishes — `tools/settlement-sweep.mjs`, `tools/marks-fold.mjs`,
// `tools/settlement-isolate.mjs` — lives in the WORLD repo and is the world's
// law, not the office's. Reader 1's risk paragraph (`jetto-g1-measure-report.md`
// § Reader 1) is explicit that the chain's most valuable machinery is everything
// wrapped around the fold, and that a rewrite which reorganises it is how four
// dated defects come back. So the store path does not teach the sweep a new
// input. It hands the sweep the input it already understands — local sketchbook
// branches — and lets the world's own law judge them exactly as before.
//
// Proven before it was written (the reproduce-first rule), on the box, against a
// clone of the live settlement clone at S63 `256db2fe`: with every
// `refs/remotes/origin/draft/*` deleted and ONE local `refs/heads/draft/*`
// carrying a store-written record, `surveySketchbooks` returned
// `{branches:1, delta_rows:1}`, `draftBranches` returned that one branch, and
// `markDelta` reported the record as an addition. A local-only sketchbook is
// fully visible to the sweep. Receipt: `docs/2026-09-08/jetto-g1-chain-report.md`
// § The design.
//
// ── THE TRAP THIS MODULE EXISTS TO CLOSE ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The settlement clone is long-lived and its origin is the world repo, so it
// ALREADY holds `refs/remotes/origin/draft/*` — 40 of them on the box today —
// left over from the git era. `settlement-sweep.mjs:325-338` surveys local and
// remote draft refs together, and `:364-379` materializes any remote draft with
// no local counterpart into a local tracking branch. So a store crossing that
// merely stopped FETCHING sketchbooks would still fold every stale git-era
// sketchbook sitting in the clone, silently, and its receipt would say the store
// was the source.
//
// `clearGitSketchbooks` is therefore not hygiene. It is the correctness argument
// for `source: store` meaning what it says, and it runs before the write-down,
// never after.
//
// ── WHAT IS REUSED, RATHER THAN REWRITTEN ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `writeDownHousehold` (world-drain.mjs) does the git half: the private index,
// the content-addressed tree, the compare-and-swap on the ref, the idempotence,
// and GATE A — "a mark's directory is its historical filing: it never moves
// again" (founder-ruled 2026-08-25). All of that is as load-bearing for a store
// write-down as for a journal one, and none of it is about where the rows came
// from. `markRecord` (mark-record.mjs) stays the ONE serializer, for the reason
// its own header gives: two copies of a serialization is how two eras come to
// disagree about the bytes of the same declaration.
//
// Env: WORLD_CLONE (default), and nothing else. This module opens no database
// and holds no credential — the store read is the caller's, handed in as data.

    // byte-identical from the store"* — and says why the corpus-wide claim is
    // not available. Measured on the live corpus at `a5ccd224`: 75 distinct
    // frontmatter field orders on disk, 40+ distinct keys against the door's 13,
    // `extent: { w, h }` on 510 files and `{ h, w }` on 36, and two value forms
    // for `points`. None of that is the store's fault and none of it is
    // reachable, because the door refuses those fields today and jsonb has no
    // key order to return.
    //
    // So a fold that re-rendered every standing mark would REWRITE the whole
    // town's history into the door's present grammar, on one crossing, under a
    // receipt that said it published a handful of marks. The git chain never
    // could: `writeDownHousehold` builds its tree from the base, so a mark no
    // sketchbook touched keeps the bytes it already has.

/**
 * THE LOUD-EMPTY GUARD, RE-DERIVED FOR THE STORE ERA.
 *
 * The git-era guard lives in the world's sweep (`settlement-sweep.mjs:1244-1251`)
 * and its evidence is branch-shaped: *"the sweep found no candidates on any
 * channel, but N escrow-backed mark(s) stand in SKETCHBOOKS"*. In the store era
 * there are no sketchbooks to be starved about, so it cannot fire. Measured, not
 * assumed: an empty store fold on a scratch produced zero sketchbooks and
 * `SETTLEMENT-SWEEP-STARVING` never appeared — the crossing was caught one layer
 * down by `marks-fold.mjs`'s stampless refusal instead. **The guard survived the
 * cutover syntactically and died semantically**, and that is why this exists.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE ORIGINAL'S, and deliberately so — the original's whole design
 * is that it *"re-derives that question by a different path"*, so a guard that
 * asked the same array twice would be a check that cannot disagree with itself:
 *
 *   the FIRST path  — the marks the fold is going to write
 *   the SECOND path — the escrow positions, which come from a different table
 *                     (`escrow_projection`, lane 2's P-006) filled by a
 *                     different writer (`stamp-ingest.mjs`, inside the
 *                     clearing's transaction) at a different time
 *
 * A crossing that writes NOTHING while the store holds staked marks is not a
 * quiet day. A crossing that writes nothing while nothing is staked is.
 *
 * AND IT MUST NOT FIRE ON A LAWFULLY QUIET DELTA, which is the trap: under the
 * delta contract a crossing may honestly carry no changed mark. That is why the
 * test is on what the fold was OFFERED, not on what it wrote — an offered set
 * that is empty while escrow stands is a store that did not answer; an offered
 * set that is entirely unchanged is a town where nothing moved, and those are
 * different states that a `written === 0` test would collapse into one.
 *
 * ── THE THIRD INPUT, AND WHY THE FIRST TWO WERE NOT ENOUGH (2026-09-09) ──────
 *
 * The paragraph above is right about which two states must not be collapsed and
 * was wrong about what `marks` is. Under `foldDelta` the OFFERED set IS the
 * docket, so "nobody claimed in this window" and "the docket had rows and the
 * mark read returned none" reached this function as the same value —
 * `marks.length === 0` — and the collapse the header was written to prevent
 * happened one field earlier than the field it inspected. The guard fired on
 * exactly the lawfully quiet delta it forbids itself.
 *
 * IT WAS NOT RARE. Measured read-only on prod, 2026-09-09, over all 30 closed
 * windows the store has ever had: 6 of them (151, 156, 157, 158, 165, 167 — one
 * in five) had an empty docket. Rehearsed end to end on a `pg_dump` scratch of
 * prod at window 180: `SETTLEMENT EXIT=1`, `world_to` empty, and a refusal
 * naming a resident's mark for a crossing in which no resident did anything.
 *
 * SO THE DOCKET'S SIZE IS PASSED IN, from `fold-delta.mjs § foldDelta`, read
 * from `claims` and not from the `marks` array this function already holds —
 * see that file for why a same-array size would be a check that cannot disagree
 * with itself. With it:
 *
 *   docketClaims === 0            → a lawful quiet crossing. Nobody locked a
 *                                 claim; there is nothing for the store to have
 *                                 failed to answer.
 *   docketClaims > 0, marks empty → `store-starving`, exactly as before. The
 *                                 docket had rows and the mark read returned
 *                                 none while escrow stands: the disagreement.
 *   docketClaims === null         → `store-starving`, exactly as before. A
 *                                 supplier that will not say how big its docket
 *                                 was has not proved the day was quiet, and an
 *                                 unproved quiet is the 2026-08-26 shape. The
 *                                 register's own entry point always says.
 *   anything else                 → `fold-input-shape`. A count is a
 *                                 non-negative integer; `""`, `false` and `[]`
 *                                 all coerce to 0 and would have read as "the
 *                                 docket was empty" on the last guard before
 *                                 publication. See `fold-delta.mjs §
 *                                 isDocketCount`, which is the one copy of that
 *                                 rule and is shared with the CLI.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD NOW RESTS ON, SAID OUT LOUD (reviewer, 2026-09-09) ───────
 *
 * Reading the docket from `claims` buys a second path, and it buys one premise
 * with it: **that every locked claim names a mark.** There is exactly one code
 * path where that is false by design — `world2/tools/materialize.mjs:122`:
 *
 *     const named = claims.filter((c) => slugOf(c));   // a stake or escrow
 *                                                      // claim names no mark
 *
 * A locked claim that names no mark is never materialized, so a window whose
 * whole docket was slugless would arrive here as `docketClaims > 0` with an
 * empty mark read while escrow stands — and would refuse, wrongly, because that
 * is a LAWFUL crossing.
 *
 * IT IS NOT REACHABLE TODAY, and that is measured rather than asserted.
 * Read-only on prod, 2026-09-09, over every claim the store holds:
 *
 *   · 831 slugless locked claims, **every one of them at window 150** — the seed
 *     import, which wrote its marks directly rather than through `materialize`
 *     (150 carries 831 locked claims, all slugless, and 820 marks)
 *   · **zero** slugless locked claims at any window after 150
 *   · so window 150 is the one window in the store's history whose entire docket
 *     is slugless — and `foldDelta` folds only the NEWEST closed window, which
 *     150 has not been for thirty windows
 *
 * The live door composes a slug on every path, which is why the count stops at
 * the import. **If that ever stops being true — a claim class that lawfully
 * names no mark reaching a live window — this guard gets a false refusal, and
 * the repair is to count only claims that name a mark.** Written here rather
 * than left for the next reader to rediscover, because the premise is invisible
 * from this file and the failure would arrive as a refusal naming a resident.

/**
 * THE HOUSEHOLD KEY IS NOT A SKETCHBOOK NAME, AND THE NAME IS LOAD-BEARING.
 *
 * Measured on a scratch clone of the live store, 2026-09-08, 1,031 standing
 * marks across 84 households: EVERY household key is prefixed, so not one of
 * them is a legal git branch component.
 *
 *     gh:<github-id>    547 marks · 52 households
 *     solo:<handle>     484 marks · 32 households   (solo:the-town alone is 378)
 *
 * The obvious move is to sanitize — `gh:67605380` becomes `gh-67605380` — and it
 * is the worst available move, because the branch name is read. The sweep's
 * AUTHORSHIP WALL resolves a sketchbook's name through main's own registry
 * (`settlement-sweep.mjs:905-919`): `wallRegistry.logins[branchName.slice(
 * "draft/".length).toLowerCase()]`, where `WORLD/households.json`'s `logins` maps
 * a lowercased GitHub login to a household key. That wall is what keeps "a mark
 * whose registered author belongs to a DIFFERENT household than the branch"
 * drafted. And its own stated rule is that a branch it cannot bind is LEFT
 * ALONE — "unverifiable is the status quo, never a new refusal".
 *
 * So invented branch names would not fail loudly. They would bind to nothing,
 * the wall would stand down for every household in the town at once, every mark
 * would publish unverified, and every test would stay green. A rename would have
 * switched off an authorship check for the whole town, silently. That is the
 * exact defect this file's own trap-closing exists to prevent, arriving from the
 * other side.
 *
 * THE MAPPING, and it is discovered rather than invented — it reproduces the
 * names the git era already uses:
 *
 *   `gh:<id>`      → the login that `logins` binds to that key. `gh:293432145`
 *                    → `aionsolare`, and origin carries `draft/AionSolare`. The
 *                    wall lowercases, so case does not matter to it.
 *   `solo:<handle>` → the handle itself. `solo:ev-attractor` → `ev-attractor`,
 *                    and origin carries `draft/ev-attractor`. These bind to
 *                    nothing in `logins` — and they bind to nothing TODAY too:
 *                    13 of the 40 git-era sketchbooks on origin are already
 *                    unbindable. Matching that is correct; making it a refusal
 *                    would be a new refusal the world's own law forbids.
 *
 * An unprefixed key is taken as-is, which is what a key with no era-marker can
 * mean. A key this cannot turn into a legal branch component REFUSES, because at
 * that point there is no honest name left to choose.
 *
 * THE RESOLVER MOVED, AND THE REFUSALS DID NOT (2026-09-09). The mapping itself
 * is now `household-logins.sketchbookNameForKey` — the same function the
 * registry's own export uses to decide which name to bind a household under, so
 * the name the map binds and the name the branch carries cannot be two different
 * strings. What stays here is the only part that is this module's: turning its
 * reported reason into a refusal that stops a crossing, in this module's words.

  // ── A MARK THE WALL CANNOT BIND IS NOT WRITTEN (ruled 2026-09-08, revised) ──
  //
  // THE FIRST RULING WAS `by: the-town`, AND IT WAS WITHDRAWN ON MEASUREMENT:
  // `by: the-town` is coextensive with household `solo:the-town` — 378 of 1,031
  // rows — so filtering on it would freeze 37% of the town, the 1f3d9/1f916
  // boarding and door marks among them, to protect six law nodes. The recorded
  // defect was never "law is in the store". It was that the write-down OPENED A
  // SKETCHBOOK for `the-town`, which is not a household the sweep's authorship
  // wall can bind.
  //
  // So the test is the wall's own: a docket mark whose household resolves to a
  // sketchbook name that `WORLD/households.json`'s `logins` cannot bind is held
  // out. It is REPORTED (`crossing_output: "unbound-household"`), it is counted
  // on the receipt, and it never opens a branch. A sketchbook the wall cannot
  // bind is a sketchbook whose marks publish unverified — the sweep leaves such
  // a branch alone rather than refusing it — so not opening one is the only
  // place this can be stopped.
  //
  // `founder_commit` rides beside it as the provenance marker and is NOT used as
  // a filter: it is present on 142 rows and covers all five of the-town's docket
  // marks, but making it a second selector would give the crossing two answers
  // to "is this mine" that can disagree.
  // ── AND THE STATED TEST DOES NOT SEPARATE THEM. MEASURED. ─────────────────
  //
  // The ruling's discriminator is "a household the wall cannot bind". Measured
  // against `WORLD/households.json` at S63: **the registry knows only the 73
  // `gh:` keys.** Every `solo:` key is absent from BOTH `households` and
  // `logins` — `solo:the-town`, and equally `solo:amia-semper`,
  // `solo:alta-of-garrison`, `solo:berthillon`, `solo:neth`. So "cannot bind"
  // holds out all 32 solo households and 484 marks, and at window 177's docket
  // it would hold out `amia-semper` and `alta-of-garrison` — **the two marks
  // S63 actually published**. The crossing would publish zero.
  //
  // That contradicts the ruling's own falsifier ("a resident's docket mark →
  // written"), so the stated test cannot be the one, and neither can the
  // registry's `households` map: it knows the same 73 keys and no more.
  //
  // WHAT THE MEASUREMENT DOES SUPPORT is the narrower sentence inside the same
  // ruling: `the-town` "is not a household". It is the town. It owns law nodes
  // that arrive by PR and ingest, and no resident's record is on the other side
  // of that line. So that is the test here — one key, FIVE marks at 177, and not
  // one resident touched.
  //
  // The registry admits a THIRD key shape besides `gh:` and `solo:` — `login:`
  // (`login:cadaeix-bot`, arky's). No standing mark carries one: measured
  // read-only against prod, 0 rows. It is named here rather than handled,
  // because a branch for a shape nothing produces is a branch nothing tests.
  //
  // `by === "the-town"` is a bare literal across this office already
  // (`world-grants.mjs:309`, `world-apex.mjs:1679`, `world-store.mjs:207`), so
  // naming it once here is the house spelling rather than a new convention.
  //
  // The broader question stays visible rather than being resolved by me: every
  // unbindable household is still reported under `wall.unbound`, so if the
  // conductor wants the wider rule the number to act on is already on the
  // receipt.
