// town-bridge.mjs — THE FERRY BRIDGE: the live invoker of the town log's drain.
//
// WAVE 4 OF POS-44, and the piece that makes the other three real. Waves 1-3
// built a log and three classes of row that go into it — joins, paper acts,
// letters — and a drain half for each: planTownDrain/writeTownDrain for joins,
// replayPaperAct for updates, replayLetter for mail. Until this file, NOTHING
// CALLED ANY OF THEM outside a test. Flag-on, the town's rows accumulated and
// the record never moved. This is the caller.
//
// ── WHERE IT RUNS, AND WHY EXACTLY THERE ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Inside the ferry's crossing, as the FIRST step of postmark-ferry.service's
// chain, before `node tools/ferry.mjs`. Three constraints pin it to that slot
// and nowhere else:
//
//   1. BEFORE THE FERRY'S SWEEP, or a letter drained after it would sit in the
//      outbox for a whole extra crossing. The row's own promise to the sender
//      is "it sails at the next crossing" (town-mail.mjs § STANDING), and the
//      sweep is what sailing means. Draining first is what makes that sentence
//      true rather than approximately true.
//   2. AFTER THE UNIT'S `git reset --hard` / `git clean -- WHITE_PAGES` crash
//      recovery, which is the first thing that ExecStart does. Anything this
//      wrote before that pair would be thrown away by it — and, read the other
//      way round, that pair is also what makes a crash INSIDE a drain cost
//      nothing. A join writes files and then commits them, so a death in
//      between leaves untracked cards under WHITE_PAGES (which `clean` removes)
//      and a modified tools/households.json (which `reset --hard` restores).
//      The rows are still pending because the cursor never moved, so the next
//      crossing starts from a clone that looks exactly as it did before.
//   3. UNDER THE UNIT'S EXISTING FLOCK, which the whole chain already holds.
//      The bridge takes no lock of its own — every unit in deploy/ wraps its
//      own ExecStart in `/usr/bin/flock -w 300 …/town.lock` and that is the
//      house idiom; a nested flock on the same path from a child would deadlock
//      against its own parent. What the bridge does instead is CHECK that
//      somebody holds it (§ the lock assertion below), which is the testable
//      form of "hold the town lock" for code that runs inside a lock it did
//      not take.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT WRITES NOTHING OF ITS OWN. Every byte that reaches the clone comes from
// the pen lane's own functions, reached through the same two replay seams the
// tests use: `buildJoinFiles`/`planRegistryJoin` for a join, and the DOOR
// ITSELF for an update or a letter, handed in as the `doors` map. This module
// is the first place in the office that assembles that map, which is precisely
// why town-updates.mjs and town-mail.mjs take it as an argument: they stay free
// of the pen, and the invoker owns the wiring. There is no second renderer of
// an ADDRESS card or a letter anywhere in this file, so there is nothing here
// that can drift from what a door writes.
//
// IT IS NOT GATED BY THE WORLD FREEZE, and that is deliberate rather than an
// omission. WORLD_FREEZE pauses GROUND acts; its own bounce says so in the
// sentence a resident reads — "reads stay open and letters sail as ever". Mail,
// paper and households are exactly the half the freeze keeps alive, so a bridge
// that checked it would stop the town for a cutover that was designed not to.
//
// IT DOES NOT DELIVER. A letter becomes an outbox file and stops there; inbox
// placement and the mail-ledger lines are the ferry's alone, because the ledger
// IS the ferry's idempotency key (town-mail.mjs § the three halves). The ferry
// runs immediately after this in the same chain and picks the letter up as an
// ordinary outbox letter.
//
// ── THE ORDER ROWS ARE REPLAYED IN ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Joins first, as ONE fold over the whole crossing — planTownDrain is written
// that way on purpose (two joins into one household must each see the other's
// effect on the registry, or both write themselves as the first). Then updates
// and letters IN SEQ ORDER among themselves, because the log is the input tense
// and its order is the only truth about what happened first. A resident who
// edited their card twice gets the second edit last, which is the same rule
// hotestFor keeps at the read side.
//
// ── IDEMPOTENCE, WHICH IS THE PROPERTY THE WHOLE ACT HANGS ON ──────────────
//
// The cursor advances LAST, after the record is durable — town-drain.mjs's own
// law: "a cursor moved before the record is durable is the one ordering that
// can lose a household". The cost of that ordering is the other failure: a
// crash between the commit and the cursor advance leaves rows that have already
// been written down still pending, and the next crossing replays them. So every
// replay path must survive being run twice over the same row:
//
//   · JOINS already do. planTownDrain skips a handle that "already stands in
//     the white pages", and the registry fold is planned against the registry
//     as it now reads.
//   · PAPER ACTS DO NOT EITHER, and this line used to say they did — "the door
//     rewrites the file with the same bytes and penCommit returns null for a
//     diff that is empty". True of the file the door wrote, and the premise it
//     hid is that the file is still that file. #2302 is what happens when it is
//     not: on 2026-08-30 a `update_profile` call carrying empty strings was a
//     documented no-op against a PROFILE.md that did not have those keys; four
//     fields were then hand-added by their owner (the road TOWN_BULLETIN's
//     build-your-profile.md advertises); and the 12:00Z crossing replayed the
//     same "clear" against a file that by then HAD them, deleting all four
//     (63a38162). Rewriting with the same bytes is only harmless when nothing
//     else has written in between, and nothing was checking.
//     So the update branch now carries the same shape the letter branch has
//     always had: the row records what the act ALREADY LANDED — the shas the
//     door's own pen returned, `payload.commits` — and a row whose every sha is
//     an ancestor of the clone's HEAD is `already`, not replayed. The companion
//     half is that a documented no-op writes no row at all (town-updates.mjs §
//     logPaperAct): a call that landed nothing has nothing to settle.
//     TWO LIMITS, STATED. A row logged before this fix carries no `commits`
//     field, and is replayed exactly as before — the guard skips only on a
//     POSITIVE match, never on an absent one, because reading absence as "no
//     commits, therefore nothing to redo" would silently un-settle every row
//     already in the log. And the ancestor question is asked of THIS clone: a
//     sha it has never seen answers "not applied" and the row replays, which is
//     the safe direction.
//   · LETTERS DO NOT, and this is the one place the bridge must think. The pen
//     lane throws 409 "that letter file already exists" on a second write — the
//     right answer for a resident sending the same letter twice, and the wrong
//     one for a drain resuming. So the bridge checks the row's OWN recorded
//     path (`payload.file`, carried by logLetter for exactly this class of
//     reader) and skips a letter already standing in its outbox, naming it
//     `already` rather than pretending it drained. It never catches the door's
//     409 to decide this: a bounce is the door's answer to a caller, and a
//     drain that read its own state out of somebody else's error string would
//     be one refactor away from silently swallowing a real defect.
//
// A letter the ferry has ALREADY DELIVERED in the same window is gone from the
// outbox, so that check would miss it — but the drain and the cursor advance
// both complete before the ferry's sweep begins, so no window exists in which
// that is reachable. It is stated here because the next person to move this
// step later in the chain needs to know what moving it costs.
//
// ── WHAT THE CURSOR OWES, IN ONE LINE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// It may advance past a row that was SETTLED or a row that was JUDGED, and
// never past a row that was DEFERRED. `settle` is the first, `skipped` is the
// second, `waiting` is the third — and only the third makes a promise, so only
// the third can be broken. Two mechanisms keep it and they compose: the gangway
// FREEZES the cursor over the rows it defers, and § the deferral tripwire
// REFUSES the crossing over any other deferred row rather than walking past it.

  // past a row that was DEFERRED. The three piles are exactly that distinction
  // — `settle` drained, `skipped` judged and done ("not a settling act", "no
  // handle", "already stands in the white pages"), `waiting` deferred — and it
  // is `waiting` alone that makes a promise the cursor can break. Passing a
  // deferred row does not merely drop it: it drops it while the report prints
  // the word that says it was kept, and the tier line's own deferral says out
  // loud to the resident "nothing about your standing expires."
  //
  // The gangway is exempt because it already keeps that promise a stronger way
  // — its rows are deferred AND the cursor is frozen for them — so the rule is
  // "deferred with nothing holding the cursor", not "deferred".
  //
  // IT CANNOT FIRE FROM A DOOR TODAY, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS CHEAP RATHER THAN
  // WHY IT IS POINTLESS. The only other deferral is the tier line, which files
  // a row with no verified GitHub id and no co-sign — and no live door can
  // write one. Both join doors carry the identity fence in the same function as
  // their append and above it (declare.mjs § 11 — the anchor, throwing 403
  // "declaring a household needs a GitHub-verified sign-in"; residency.mjs §
  // requestResidency, the same). Every credential shape either carries `ghId`
  // or is refused there: OAuth tokens and household keys always carry it, an
  // un-cosigned berth key carries none and is bounced, a cosigned berth upgrades
  // in place to its human's id, and a static key with no gh_id has no GitHub
  // identity at all. Nor does the berth arc open a window: `household do:
  // "begin"` PARKS the declaration on the berth row and writes no journal row
  // ("nothing is executed until the click"), and the co-sign runs the parked
  // declaration under the human's just-verified identity, so the row is born
  // anchored. Verified over real HTTP against the live doors, 2026-08-24: berth
  // boards, begins, and tries both join doors — zero rows written, zero
  // unanchored.
  //
  // So this guards the same class the foreign-class tripwire above guards, in
  // the same shape and for its own stated reason: "a hand-run migration, a
  // restored backup, a future class added to the schema before its drain half
  // exists" — plus the one it does not name, a future door that relaxes the
  // fence. It REFUSES rather than passing over, and refusing holds the ferry's
  // `&&`-joined chain on purpose, for that tripwire's own reason: a refusal
  // means the office does not understand its own log, and delivering mail on
  // top of that is building on a floor nobody has checked.
  //

  // A REPLAY THAT BOUNCES IS RECORDED AND PASSED OVER — it does not stop the
  // crossing, and the choice is not obvious, so here is the whole reasoning.
  //
  // The door already judged this act when it wrote the row (validateLetter at
  // sendLetterAsRow, the paper doors' own fences), so a bounce here means the
  // town changed between the writing and the boat — a recipient who left, a
  // handle that stopped being one of yours. Rare, and possible.
  //
  // The two alternatives are both worse. Letting the throw out would leave the
  // cursor unmoved, which is correct for the row and catastrophic for the town:
  // the ferry chain is `&&`-joined, so ONE bad row would hold every crossing
  // after it, forever, and the mail would simply stop. Passing over silently
  // would be the drain deciding on its own that somebody's letter did not
  // happen.
  //
  // Recording it is safe HERE and would not be safe in the world drain, and the
  // difference is one line of SQL: the world's drain TRUNCATES (`DELETE FROM
  // journal WHERE seq <= head`), so a row it passes over is gone. This log is
  // never truncated — the cursor is the only thing that moves — so a bounced
  // row is still sitting in `town_journal` afterwards, with its seq, its
  // arguments and its defect written into this report. Nothing is lost; an
  // operator is told, and the boat sails.
  //
  // A PUSH THAT CANNOT LAND IS HELD, NEVER BOUNCED (POS-296, Wright's ruling
  // 2026-09-28). The pen is whole or nothing now: a push that loses its race
  // three times leaves no file and no commit behind. Recording that as a bounce
  // and moving the cursor past it would drop a letter the door told its sender
  // was accepted — before POS-296 the stranded local commit sailed on the
  // ferry's own push, and now there is nothing left to sail. So the row is
  // HELD: the cursor stays below it, exactly as it does for a stalled join, and
