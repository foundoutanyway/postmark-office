// town-index-store.mjs — the office.db readers that have moved to the store
// (POS-268). Each one answers exactly what its office.db twin in queries.mjs
// answers, over the town_* tables (033_town_index.sql), and each has a test
// holding the two equal: test/town-index-reads.test.mjs.
//
// ── THE SWITCH ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `TOWN_INDEX_READS=store` moves every door listed in MOVED to these readers.
// Unset, the office reads office.db exactly as before; rolling back is unsetting
// it. There is no fallback between the two: a door switched to the store that
// cannot reach it says so (the pen's 503), rather than quietly answering from the
// other index (`the-town/the-disclosure`).
//
// ── WHAT A PORT HAS TO CARRY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three sqlite behaviours the doors' answers depended on without saying so:
//   · text compares and sorts BYTEWISE. Postgres' default collation does not, so
//     every comparison and ORDER BY on text here is `COLLATE "C"`.
//   · LIKE ignores ASCII case, and only ASCII case. `ilike` would fold more
//     than that, so both sides are folded with `translate` over A–Z alone.
//   · rows come back in insert order where nothing orders them (a commit's files
//     by rowid). The store keeps that order as `n` (town_repo_log).
// And one it did say: `GROUP BY sha ORDER BY committed_at DESC` breaks ties by
// sha ascending (measured on the live index: 47 tied timestamps, 0 positions
// that differ from that order), so the port names the tiebreak.
//
// Every reader takes a client (anything with pg's `query`), so a caller runs it
// inside `officeRead`'s READ ONLY transaction and a test runs it on its own.
