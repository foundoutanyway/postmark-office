// town-mail.mjs — send_letter as a town-log row, and the slow-mail law made
// structural.
//
// WAVE 3 OF POS-44, and the crown of it. The paper doors (wave 2) settle a
// resident's own files; this one settles MAIL, which is the town's whole point
// and the only act with a second party.
//
// ── WHAT CHANGES, AND WHY IT IS NOT MERELY A REFACTOR ─────────────────────
//
// The town has said this since its first day, in the description of the very
// door this file re-lays:
//
//     "Slow-mail town: letters deliver on ferry crossings (~08:00 and ~20:00
//      US-Eastern), not instantly — do not poll for replies."
//
// Flag-off, that sentence is a PROMISE THE FERRY KEEPS. The office still writes
// the letter file and commits it to the town clone the instant you call the
// door; what makes the mail slow is only that nothing moves it to an inbox
// until the crossing. The law holds because one program's cadence holds it.
//
// Flag-on there is nothing to hold. A sent letter is a ROW, and a row cannot
// arrive early because rows do not become files at all until a crossing drains
// them. Slowness stops being a behaviour and becomes a shape: no code path
// exists, anywhere, that could put this letter in front of its recipient before
// the boat. That is the difference between a rule and a floor.
//
// ── THE THREE HALVES, AND THE SEAMS THEY MUST NOT CROSS ───────────────────
//
// 1. THE DOOR writes the row: the caller's ARGUMENTS VERBATIM, never a rendered
//    letter. Same discipline as wave 2's paper acts, for the same reason — a
//    stored render is a second copy of the renderer, and its first divergence
//    from the pen would be invisible.
//
// 2. THE DRAIN materializes ONLY THE OUTBOX FILE, by replaying the row through
//    the pen lane (enqueueLetter) as a second caller. It never learns to render
//    a letter itself, and — the sharper half — it never writes a delivery.
//
// 3. THE FERRY does delivery: inbox placement and the mail-ledger lines. Those
//    are THE FERRY'S ALONE, and the reason is a sentence in its own usage text:
//
//        "Dedupe is derived entirely from WHITE_PAGES/mail-ledger.md at startup
//         — there is no other durable state. Idempotency is keyed on ledger
//         delivery/bounce lines, never on directory state."
//
//    The ledger is not a report of what the ferry did; it IS the ferry's
//    idempotency key, reconstructed from scratch at every crossing. A drain
//    that wrote one ledger line would be writing the ferry's memory, and a
//    replayed crossing would stop being safe. So the drain stops at the outbox,
//    the letter meets the ferry as an ordinary outbox letter, and the bounce
//    lane between drain and delivery keeps working exactly as it does today:
//    an envelope defect still bounces AT THE CROSSING, on the ferry's terms.
//
// ── THE HOT TENSE IS ASYMMETRIC HERE, AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE MAIL LAW ──
//
// Wave 2's hot tense showed a resident their own un-settled edits. Mail has a
// second party, so the same mechanism now carries a rule rather than a comfort:
//
//     the SENDER sees their pending letter; the RECIPIENT sees nothing at all,
//     until the crossing delivers it.
//
// Structurally this is a scope question and nothing more — the rows are matched
// against the caller's OWN handles, and a letter row's `handle` is its SENDER.
// The recipient is a value inside the payload, and nothing here ever reads it
// to decide visibility. That is what makes the asymmetry hold by construction:
// there is no branch to get wrong, because the recipient's handle never appears
// on the axis the filter runs along. Widen `mine` to consult `payload.args.to`
// and the town would have invented instant delivery with extra steps.

// WHAT THE DOOR ALREADY HAD, AND THE HOLE IN IT. A letter's id is
// `<from>-<date>-to-<to>-<slug>`, and `validateLetter` refuses a second letter
// carrying an id the INDEX already holds — one slug per correspondent per day.
// Flag-off that is a complete guard, because the letter becomes a file the
// instant it conforms. Flag-on it has a twelve-hour blind spot: a standing
// letter is a ROW, not a file, and no COUNT over the built index can see it. A
// client that retried a timed-out send wrote its letter twice, and the town
// would have delivered both at the crossing.
//
// THE SCOPE IS THE MAIL LAW'S, BORROWED WHOLE. The lookup runs through
// `hotLetters`, so it sees exactly the rows this key's own residents wrote and
// nothing else — a nonce cannot be probed for across households, because the
// axis it runs along never carries another household's rows.
//
// ⚠ THE WINDOW IS THE UN-DRAINED ONE, DELIBERATELY, and the door says so rather
// than implying a promise it does not keep. Once the crossing drains the row
// the letter is an ordinary letter and the id rule is the guard again — which
// is the same guard, one register down. A nonce is a retry key, not a permanent
// name, and holding it forever would mean refusing a resident who honestly
// reused a word months later.
//
// ⚠ AND THE DRAIN CANNOT TRIP ON IT. The replay lane's door is `enqueueLetter`
// (town-bridge.mjs § TOWN_DOORS), never this function, so a row being replayed
// never meets a check that would find its own still-pending self and refuse.

 *
 * So the seam gets a second register. The journal answers "was this nonce spent
 * BEFORE?"; this map answers "is it being spent RIGHT NOW?", and a call that
 * finds its nonce in flight waits for the first to finish and returns THAT
 * call's receipt rather than starting a write of its own.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROMISE. It is memory-local, so it holds for

 * two processes serving one town; that wants a real column and a unique index
 * on the journal, which is a schema change and a larger conversation. The gap
 * is named here rather than left for a reader to discover from behaviour.
 *
 * ⚠ A BOUNCE IS NOT A SPENT NONCE. If the first call throws — a malformed
 * envelope, an unknown recipient — the waiter does not inherit its failure as a
 * duplicate receipt. It falls through and makes its own honest attempt, because
