// town-posts.mjs — THE TOWN'S POSTS, ONE READ THAT TAKES A CLASS (POS-294).
//
// The Posts project, § Ruled for phase 1: "one `posts` read that takes a class
// (the per-class reads become aliases, then retire). Every class declares its
// finished states." So:
//
//   town { read: "posts", args: { class, post? } }     GET /posts?class=…
//                                                       GET /posts/<author>/<slug>
//
// answers every post of the class as the general row (posts-fields.md § 4:
// class, id, title, author, household, state, latest, responses), plus what
// the class joins to it, and the class's `finished` states beside the list.
// `town { read: "quest" }` is the quest class's alias (unlisted on the menu).
//
// ── ONE QUESTION, ONE OWNER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The posts table has one reader: household-posts.mjs § postRowsOf, which the
// household's own posts read already asks. This file asks it too, keeping every
// post instead of the house's, and adds nothing to what it reads from the
// table. A second SELECT on `posts` here would be two answers to one question.
//
// ── A QUEST'S TERMS ARE THE REGISTRY'S ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A quest row carries its registry id (`fields.quest`). Its `terms` (title,
// source, reward, cadence, target) are joined from the town's
// quest-registry.json at read time, so the registry stays the source and an
// edit to it is on the next read. A row whose registry entry is gone says so
// (`terms: null`) rather than borrowing the stored title as if it were terms.
// Progress is not here: it is derived from the letters (read: "quests").
// Quests answer in the registry's own order, the order the board draws them.
//
// ── THE CLASSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// event, quest, bug and idea. An idea is a post since POS-290 (behind
// IDEA_POSTS for the acts; the read reports what the store holds, which is
// nothing until the switch has been on). The Think Tank's marks stay marks and
// are read at town { read: "ideas" }, beside these posts.
//
// ── THE BUG READ PAGES (POS-558, Darko 2026-10-10) ──────────────────────────
//
// "We already need a page-based load instead of just dropping all of them,
// because this is going to get really big really fast." The bug list answers
// in the office's paged-read grammar (queries.mjs: the roll, the mail,
// correspondents, regions): `limit` (default BUG_PAGE, max 200) and `offset`
// in; `total` (every bug), `shown`, `limit`, `offset`, `complete`, and
// `next_offset` with `more_note` while there is more, out. The order is the
// jar's (bugs.mjs § THE JAR'S ORDER: open by the furthest stage, the named,
// the legacy shelf, the set aside), so the pages read like the jar; the shared
// postOrder, which events and quests read, is not touched. A page cannot add
// up the town, so every
// page also carries `catchers`, the Hall of Fame's totals over the whole
// record (bugs.mjs § THE CATCHERS): the history is still read for every bug,
// as it was before the read paged. The other classes are not paged.
//
// ── A BUG CARRIES ITS OWN FIELDS ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A bug row (bugs.mjs) adds its class `fields` to the general row: the
// reporter's issue, steps and record, and whatever its advances set (size,
// critter and named_by at fixed, grade at briefed, `of` at duplicate). Its state is its stage.
//
// ── EVERY POST CARRIES ITS HISTORY (POS-547, generalized for POS-290) ───────
//
// Who did each stage is on the acts, and what each stage paid is on the signed
// ledger, so the read joins both: `history`, one row per act that moved the
// post, shaped by its class (post-history.mjs, the one reader; a bug's rows are
// bugs.mjs § THE HISTORY, an idea's ideas.mjs's, an event's and a quest's the
// post and its close). It rides on every row of the list as well as on
// the one post, because the Bug Catcher's page draws every bug's ladder from
// one read (measured on the 48 bugs of 2026-10-09 in POS-547's report). The ledger is the store's
// `stamp_lines` (066), never the town's file, read as a delta past what this
// process already read (post-history.mjs § the chain is read as a delta). An office whose store has no
// chain yet (before 066, or before its first sync) says so in `unavailable`
// and answers stamps_paid null, rather than calling every stage unpaid.
