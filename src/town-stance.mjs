//
// ── THE RULINGS THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS (Darko, 2026-10-06, deep slot 1) ───────
//
//   · Words: the town reuses the resident tri-state. A declared NEUTRAL clears
//     "awaiting the town" and confers nothing; OPPOSED is unchanged; the town's
//     WELCOMED is adoption, reserved, and refused for now. Silence leaves the
//     mark awaiting. Residents may also declare neutral (it clears "awaiting
//     your word"). One taxonomy.
//   · Verb: no new verb. The town speaks with `declare-stance-on`.
//   · Speaker: postmark-pen, household the-town, as town quest posts already
//     are (quests.mjs § the hand). The act names the hand that held the pen.
//   · Citations: law marks only, in the shape the world lints use (`law` = the
//     mark id, `law_text` = its words verbatim; world-lints.mjs § the law).
//   · Cutover (Q4): TOWN_STANCE_CUTOVER=S<n>, set by Wright at the deploy.
//   · Version (Q5): every stance records the mark version it was spoken on; a
//     stale version is absent, so an amendment reopens every word.
//   · Awaiting (Q6): the stance door's overlap rule, grouped by HOUSEHOLD, with
//     seniority (a holder speaks only on marks younger than their ground).
//
// The world half is postmark-world#146: `resolveConsent({ …, townWords })`
// takes the map `townWordsOf` builds here. Wiring it into the clearing is
// POS-362's; the settlement reads `townWordsAtOffice()` below.

// the SAME claim id it was handed (so a word spoken on a sketch survives its
// publish, the-late-welcome), and the standing recompute's data.tier and a

 * geometry, parent slug, data) also moves when nothing was amended:
 *   · the standing recompute rewrites data.tier when ground moves
 *     (world2/tools/materialize.mjs § the tier step), and
 *   · a parent's retirement nulls the parent slug in the row.
 * Both must reopen nothing. And a sketch's claim row never equals its published
 * row, so the digest would reopen every word spoken before the publish, which
 * is the-late-welcome undone; the clearing locks the same claim id instead.
 *
 * `current` is the newest LOCKED claim when the slug has one (what stands; a
 * pending amendment has not published and does not reopen anything yet), else
 * the newest unpublished claim. `claims` is every row, oldest first, for the
 * legacy read (`versionAt`).
 *
 * AS OF A SEAL (POS-362): with `window`, a claim counts as locked only when it
 * locked at or before that window (a seed claim with no window stood before any),
 * so `current` is the version that stood when that window was sealed. The rows
 * handed in are the claims submitted by then (§ readVersionsAtSeal).
 *
 * WITH `at` (the seal's taken_at), a claim counts as locked only when it was
 * DECIDED by then. The window alone is not enough: review-rule.mjs locks a
 * held_review claim later and keeps its submit window_id, so a review granted
 * in W+1 would otherwise rewrite what the asked S(W) shows. The clearing and
 * review-rule both set decided_at = now(), and the seal's taken_at is its own
 * transaction's now(), so `decided_at <= at` is exactly "locked at the seal"
