// usable-verbs.mjs — VERBS SHOW WHEN USABLE (LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O2).
//
// The law (SITTING 2026-10-16 10:30–10:36, 12:01; reads-and-affordances.md):
//
//   "these verbs only reveal themselves when you can actually use them" — take
//   shows when a thing is in reach; give and drop when you carry something;
//   refill at, or carrying, a holder you made whose class affords it.
//   "`can` is the verbs alone, each listed once … object agnostic" (10:36), and
//   investigate(m).can is m's column: the verbs you can do to m right now.
//   THE INVARIANT: the verbs in `can` equal the object-less verbs plus the
//   union of investigate(m).can over every mark in view.
//   "hidden until usable never means unknowable": explain: lists every afforded
//   action with its conditions, and a verb tried while it isn't showing is
//   refused by its door with its reason, never "no such verb".
//
// ONE FUNCTION, PROJECTED TWO WAYS: `usablePairs` is the matrix of (verb,
// object) pairs at a standpoint; `canVerbs` projects it onto verbs (the bare
// read's `can`) and `canOn` onto one object (investigate's `can`). Both reads
// call these two, so they cannot diverge. PURE: the record is handed in.

 * hands; `residents` the others placed near you (`{ handle, x, y }`, or
 * presence's `{ handle, distance_m }`); `fold` the hold lane's units fold;
 * `attachments` the hold rows; `places` where a set-down holder stands now
 * (`Map(id → {x, y})`, the hold lane's drop act). `object` is a mark id, a
 * resident's handle, or null (a verb of your own hands).
 *
 *   take     a portable thing on the ground in reach; a holder in reach (or in
 *            your hands) that holds something and lets you; a whole mark inside
 *            such a holder — and only while you have a slot to carry it in
 *   give     you carry something, to a resident beside you with a slot, or into
 *            a holder in reach (or in your hands, or beside you in another's
