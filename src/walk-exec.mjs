// departure can never race a crossing or another write. The office pen is the
// SINGLE writer of the movement ledger, and it writes at verb time — a departure
// is recorded when it is declared, not on the ferry's cadence.
//
// It appends ONE LINE and commits. Nothing else: no arrival record, no en-route
// state, no world-state regeneration — position is derived by every reader from
// (record, clock), so there is nothing else to persist. That is why this exec is
// so much smaller than leave-exec.
//
// The grammar travels with the clone: `tools/walk.mjs` is imported from the
// CLONE, exactly as leave-exec imports the clone's placementParent. The enforcer
// and the record must agree, and the clone owns both.
//
// Env: WORLD_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1 to push, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's).

Append-only. One line per DEPARTURE; position is a pure function of the line and
the clock, so nothing en-route is ever written here and no arrival is recorded.
Superseding a walk is a new departure from the derived position — latest wins.
Stopping is a zero-distance departure.

Grammar: \`- <iso> · <handle> · from <x>,<y> · toward <x>,<y> · at <fractional-crossing>[ · within <w>,<h>][ · to <mark-id>]\`

The optional \`within <w>,<h>\` freezes the target's arrival rect; the trailing
\`to <mark-id>\` records what was ASKED FOR. Derivation never re-resolves the id —
the centre and extent are already on the line — so a mark that later moves,
resizes, or retires cannot rewrite where someone walked.
