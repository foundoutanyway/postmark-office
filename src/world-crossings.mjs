// A stop on a vehicle's timetable is a DOOR INTO HER, wherever her hull is. You
// must stand at the stop — the 2026-08-27/09-11 reach rule is unchanged and is
// measured at the STOP, which is the mark you named. What changes is which
// threshold you cross: the vehicle's, not the wharf's.
//
// ⚑ THE PORTAL CROSSING IS ONE LINK, AND IT HAS TO BE. Measured against world
// main `5beca99a`: `enterExitPlan` computes the Post Office's chain as
// `the-town/the-town-centre → the-town/the-quay-reach → the-town/the-post-office`
// — her geometric ancestors at her berth. Running a portal entry through
// `verbs.enter` would therefore write THREE ledger rows and put a resident
// standing on the Garrison's wharf inside the town centre, five kilometres from
// any of it, because the chain is computed from the TARGET's static geometry and
// a portal's passage is not geometric. The brief's own words are "ONE enter row
// … object the-town/the-post-office", and this is that sentence in code.
//
// So the adjudication is the CLONE's, one link: `adjudicate` and
// `formatEnterExit` out of the grammar module the office already loads. The
// office does not invent an entry law here any more than it does anywhere else;
// it asks the same law about one door instead of about a chain.

  // the outer links first; it is the STANDING that is now asked about the mark
  // the resident actually asked for.
  //
  // WHY `answer.walk` STILL GUARDS IT. The engine sets `walk` to null exactly

  // `pointWithinMark` for `standsWithin` to borrow.

  // ⚑ THE TEST MOVED OUT, THE LAW DID NOT (lane-h, 2026-09-07). It is
  // `standsWithin` in reach.mjs, because `the-town/the-reach` rules that a take
  // stands within a thing's extent "exactly as an entry stands at a threshold
  // you truly stand before" — and "exactly as" is only true if it is the same

      // town centre AND the-town/the-quay-reach). A set-down 9.9 km away carries

      // true` is DEC-5's documented route for a caller who is within a room: the
      // exits are performed innermost outward, each standing as its own act on
      // the record, and the walk follows. WHAT is actually left is the walk
      // door's judgement — `leavingWhileOccupying` over the live stack — and it
      // is not re-derived here; this side only answers whether there is anything

Mutual consent, or the effect is null. A mark that has written no entry law answers neutral and lets you in; a mark whose law declares a counter-edge (the Post Office's `aboard`) shows you its terms and records nothing until you pass accept: true. OPPOSED IS A REFUSAL AT THE THRESHOLD: you are left standing at that door, and everything you crossed before it still stands. A door is entered from within its extent: from outside it, the enter is refused and records nothing, and the refusal names the walk to the threshold in its `walk` field (R15 keeps walk and entry decoupled). To walk there and step in on arrival in one call, use world_walk with mark_id and enter_on_arrival: true. Naming a deep target enters the CHAIN — each door adjudicated in turn, so an effect-bearing door cannot be bypassed by naming a room behind it.
