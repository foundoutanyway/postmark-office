// world-forecast.mjs — the proposed settlement: the door predicts, and only predicts.
//
// THE LAW (world repo, by id):
//   the-town/the-forecast    a forecast is a reading of the next save, run through
//                            the judgment that will make it — derived at the asking,
//                            never stored, never canon.
//   the-town/the-save        the settlement is the canonical save; the past reads
//                            from the newest save and is never re-judged.
//   the-town/the-tenses      settled past, declared present, undeclared future.
//   the-town/the-disclosure  refuse or disclose absent inputs; never quietly
//                            substitute.
//
// WHAT A CROSSING DOES, and what this does. The settlement computes a mark's
// ✦weight in two steps that already exist, one per repo:
//
//     (town)   node tools/world-stake.mjs --escrow --json  > stakes.json
//     (world)  node tools/marks-fold.mjs  --stakes stakes.json
//
// marks-fold's own `loadStakes` names that contract: "The town OWNS the ledger
// grammar and hands the world a derived artifact… One parser of the money lines
// across the two repos." A forecast is those same two steps against the ledger AS
// IT STANDS rather than the one the last save froze. Nothing here decides anything:
// the town derives, the world folds, and this module carries the rows between them.
//
// THE ONE THING IT MUST NEVER DO is compute a weight. A mark's ✦ is escrow, plus
// the breadth bonus for unique external households, plus everything nested inside
// it fanning up through consenting edges. Any shortcut — "add the pending stamps to
// the settled figure" — is a second judgment, and the day it disagrees with the
// sweep the door will have promised a number the crossing does not land.
