// world-grants.mjs — THE PERMISSION CALCULUS, as three channels.
//
// ── THE LAW THIS IMPLEMENTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// LOGOS/classes.md § Class-nodes has said since 2026-08-15, verbatim:
//
//   "The resident class carries every resident's standing capabilities,
//    world-wide by its own ambient declaration; a ground's class may grant
//    more to those it reaches."
//
// The office implemented only the first half. `gatherActions` asks the store
// for class marks whose id is on the caller's spine or in their reach — but a
// class mark is DE-SITED (LOGOS, 2026-08-18: "law has no where"), so it can
// never BE on a geometric spine. The second clause therefore reached nothing,
// and had reached nothing for eleven days: the only doors that ever opened were
// the ambient ones. That is not a bug in the SQL; it is a missing seam.
//
// This module is the seam. It resolves the marks a caller is standing on to the
// CLASSES they are instances of, and reads those classes' contracts. Plus the
// third channel LOGOS § The three channels names beside it — what you carry.
//
//   ambient        what you ARE      the actor class's own `ambient: true` grants
//   ground         where you STAND   the class of each mark on your spine/reach
//   held           what you CARRY    the `held-grant` on a thing in your hands
//
// ── WHY THE GROUND GRANTS THROUGH ITS CLASS AND NEVER THROUGH THE INSTANCE ───
//
// An instance that could mint its own verbs would be a private grammar with a
// fence around it (atom 1), and the store's own gate already says so: a mark
// mints a verb only if it is `by: the-town`, `tier: constitution`, and standing
// in the Keeping Works. Rei's parcel is none of those and must not become any
// of them. So the resolution is instance → class NAME → the class mark, and the
// class mark passes the same gate it always did. Nothing here widens that gate.
//
// ── AND WHY `held` HAS A DIFFERENT CUSTODY ──────────────────────────────────
//
// A held thing is an INSTANCE — that is the whole point of a magic weapon: two
// of them differ. So the held-grant lives on the object (the `held-grant` slot,
// unsealed on the thing class), and the custody is AUTHORSHIP: `by: the-town`.
// Tier is the obvious guard and it is the wrong one, because atom 11 says tier
// is never asserted and standing is derived from ground — and a held thing has
// no ground. It is not ground (the-not-ground), and it rides its holder
// (the-anchor). A constitution-tier object lying on a floor would be claiming a
// standing its own position law forbids it.
//
// PURE. No store handle, no clone, no network — rows in, entries out. The apex
// owns the queries; this owns the law. That split is what lets the falsifiers
// assert the law without standing up a world.

 * THE SEAT — the calculus as an actor who may be SEATED reads it.
 *
 * LOGOS/classes.md § The three channels, verbatim (founder-ruled 2026-08-29):
 *
 *   "A ground seats a human when its class actually grants that human something
 *    — an entry whose `for:` names them, admitted through the ground channel,
 *    with the relation `scope:` demands satisfied. This is derived, never
 *    declared: a ground seats whoever it is already lending verbs to, so the
 *    seating and the grant cannot disagree."
 *
 *   "Inside such a ground the human's affordances are the RESIDENT set — walk,
 *    say, enter, exit, give, take, and the ground's own verbs beside them."
 *
 *   "Outside a seating ground, nothing changes. A human affords nothing
 *    ambiently, anywhere, exactly as before."
 *
 * ⚑ SEATING IS DERIVED FROM THE ADMITTED SET, NOT FROM THE CANDIDATES, and the
 * difference is a whole security property. A guest's human standing on somebody
 * else's parcel HAS a candidate entry — the parcel class grants `for: human` —
 * and `scope: own-ground` refuses it. Reading seating off the candidates would
 * seat that guest in a stranger's garden and hand them the resident set there.
 * So the first resolution runs in full, scope and all, and only what SURVIVES
 * it can seat anybody.
 *
 * A resident is never "seated": they hold the resident set by being one, and
 * asking the question of them would be asking whether they may be themselves.

 * ── THE THIRD WAY A SEAT ARISES (world#16, PROPOSED 2026-09-07) ─────────────
 *
 * LOGOS/classes.md § The human class — the handoff, verbatim:
 *
 *   "`hand-to-human` is an ambient grant on the resident class whose residue is
 *    a fleeting node … While a handoff stands, THE HUMAN IS SEATED AT THE
 *    RESIDENT'S STANDING, WHOLE — the seat ruling applies unchanged … This adds
 *    no verb to the human class and no field to any record; IT ADDS ONE MORE
 *    WAY THE DERIVATION 'WHO IS SEATED HERE' COMES OUT TRUE."
 *
 * That last clause is an instruction about where the code goes, and it is why
 * `opts.handoff` is an ARGUMENT to this function rather than a reader inside
 * it. This is the office's ONE answer to who is seated; a second reader living
 * beside it would agree the day it was written and disagree the first time
 * either moved. So the door folds the log and hands the seat over; the calculus
 * decides, once, here.
 *
 * ⚑ A HANDOFF SEAT IS NOT A GROUND, and `seated` therefore stays null for one.
 * Three things downstream read `seated` as a ground id — the apex's `seatBlock`,
 * the walk fence, and `exitAllowed` — and the law's own sentence is why they
 * must not be handed a handoff there: the seat "is the resident's standing, not
 * a ground … it moves with the resident and ends at the ttl, NOT AT A FENCE".
 * So it rides its own key, and a caller that fences on `seated` fences on

 * The guard a residue class puts in gate position.

 * LOGOS § The derived, verbatim: "Guards are deriveds in gate position: a verb
 * or slot may name a derived and a required value as its precondition — that is
 * the whole condition grammar."
 *
 * `within_class` is the one that fences the portal's verbs to the portal. It is
 * checked against the caller's own containment spine, which is a DERIVED — read
 * at the door, stored by nobody. Without it the held channel is
 * location-independent by construction, and a weapon carried home from a party
 * would grant `strike` on the quay.
 *
 * `phase` is the encounter's own derived and is passed in rather than computed:
 * this module does not know what a fight is, and should not learn.
