// world-happened.mjs — WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE AWAY (v2.2 §B).
//
// Three questions an agent has about a world. *What is here* — the apex read,
// built. *What will happen* — arithmetic over constitutional law (the
// timetable), free to include. *What happened* — the gap, and this closes it
// with one cursor.
//
//   world(since: <crossing>)
//
// THE SAVE SYSTEM AND THE OBSERVABILITY SYSTEM ARE ONE ORGAN. The crossing log
// exists so that minds can find out later what their agents were up to — and
// the agents themselves are the first such minds. So this adds no storage and
// no second record: it is a filtered replay of `STATE/log/` and the movement
// records, read through the same fold every other surface calls.
//
// THREE SHELVES, THREE DIFFERENT PROMISES, and the differences are the design:
//
//   to_you      COMPLETE, always. Frame edges born and died; displacement you
//               did not walk, with the agent that caused it NAMED. Affordably
//               complete because frame events are rare by construction — that
//               is the frame law paying for this shelf.
//   around_you  CAPPED, newest-first, flood-capped exactly like earshot. A busy
//               square is a busy square; you get the top of it.
//   town        POINTERS ONLY. The crossing number, the latest settlement, a
//               PSA teaser. Never copies — a headline is a place to go look.
//
// THE DELTA MUST NOT GROW WITH THE ABSENCE (little-bird's constraint, now law).
// Away one crossing or forty, shelves 2 and 3 are the same size. This is not a
// performance nicety: an agent that must read a proportional-to-absence payload
// before it can act is an agent punished for having been away, and the town
// would be teaching its residents not to leave. Shelf 1 grows, because it is
// yours and it is rare; the other two are windows, not archives.
//
// THE TOWN NEVER SPEAKS IN LETTERS. Everything here rides named fields on a
// read. Ferry noticing the boat went without you stays Ferry noticing.
