// world-hold.mjs — WHO HOLDS WHAT. The object primitive's one verb.
//
// `give`, `drop` and `take` are three faces of one act: DECLARE THE HOLDING.
// The edit law has one primitive ("to act is to declare an edge; everything
// else is clothing"), so there is one executor here and three actions on the
// class mark, because the vocabulary a resident reads and the machinery that
// runs are allowed to differ in number.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT CONTAINMENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN ───────────────────
//
// The obvious implementation is "the thing's containment edge points at the
// resident, and children ride their parent's frame." It cannot be built, and
// the reason is law rather than a gap:
//
//   AN ENTITY HAS NO GEOMETRIC PARENT, EVER (LOGOS/kinds.md, restated at
//   dynamic-store.mjs § entities and dynamic-entities.mjs law 2). The entities
//   table has no parent column and never will. A resident is not a mark, has no
//   directory in WORLD/marks/, and cannot be a carrier — carriers are marks
//   with `mobility: derived|free` AND a `mechanic:` (world-frames.mjs), and
//   that `mechanic` clause exists precisely so that standing in the building
//   that houses a class is not riding it.
//
// So carrying is the OTHER edge the LOGOS already named, and which has stood in
// the Keeping Works since 2026-08-09 without ever having a verb:
//
//   the-town/attachment — "An attachment is born saying what becomes of it if
//   what it holds to moves — carried along, or set down."
//
// Its table and its writer shipped in Stage 2 with a comment saying the verb
// that calls them "lands with the vessel work." It did not. This is that verb.
//
// ── POSITION IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A held thing's world position is `holder's position + offset`, computed on
// read — the same arithmetic world-frames.mjs already runs for passengers, and
// the same discipline the-north-star.md states ("derived things are stored by
// no one"). The alternative — rewriting the mark's `at:` on every hand-off —
// would be a git commit per transfer AND would store a derived quantity. The
// mark file of a thing is BYTE-IDENTICAL across any number of gives; a test
// asserts exactly that, because it is the claim most worth being able to break.
//
// ── HELD vs SET DOWN, and the one judgement call in this file ────────────────
//
// The attachments table is store-canon-DURABLE and replayed by the crossing
// save, so it is the wrong table to migrate on a first pass. It carries no
// `closed_at`, so "set down" needs a spelling in the columns that exist.
//
// The spelling: LATEST ROW PER TARGET WINS (`born_at`, then `seq` — the order
// readAttachments already returns and a replay already applies), and `policy`
// says whether that latest row is a holding:
//
//   policy: cascade   HELD. It comes along when the holder moves.
//   policy: detach    SET DOWN. The edge is in the log; the holding is not.
//
// This reads the column with its own declared meaning ("carried along, or set
// down") and needs no migration. It is nonetheless A CHOICE I MADE, not a
// ruling I was given, and it is the thing to overturn first if the store ever
// grows an explicit terminal column — at which point `liveHolder` below is the
// one function that changes.

// world PR #21, LOGOS/classes.md § The reach of a hold, verbatim in four
// clauses: a take is a threshold act; a set-down stands where you stood; a give
// is a take at arm's length; only what stands on the world changes hands.
//
// ⚑ AT THE DOOR, NOT IN `declareHolding`, for the third time in this file and
// the same reason both times before: `declareHolding` is the pure adjudicator,
// tested on hand-built stores with no world db anywhere near it, and a reach
// check inside it would hand every one of those tests a world engine, a clone
// and a walk ledger it has no business having. The door is where the world
// already is. What `declareHolding` keeps is the part that needs no geometry:
// who holds what, and which of the three faces this act is.
//
// ⚑ IT REFUSES ONLY WHAT IT CAN PROVE. Every failure to READ (no world engine,
// a clone that will not answer, a standpoint derivation that throws) falls
// through to the ordinary door. A door that turned an unreadable world into
// "you are not standing there" would make an outage look like a refusal, and a
// resident would have no way to tell those two apart. What it refuses is what
// it measured: a distance it computed, or a canon it read and did not find.

 *
 * This shelf used to open the sqlite journal, and the journal was never the
 * record for a holding — it was a window onto one, and a narrow one twice over.
 * Before the hold lane's pen flipped (2026-09-03T18:58:05Z) a holding act took
 * NO journal row at all: `mirrorHoldingAct` wrote `acts` and nothing else, by
 * world-journal.mjs's own § THE LANE HOOK. After the flip the journal row is
 * the reverse mirror's best-effort copy, and `world-drain.mjs` truncates it at
 * every drain. So walk #11's certified zero had a second way to happen that
 * fixing the wiring never touched: the give was real, the shelf was reading a
 * window the drain had already closed.
 *
 * The store read is the whole read. No flag, no fallback underneath — one
 * question, one owner.
 *
 * The bounds are pushed because this shelf narrows by crossing anyway
 * (`holdEffectsFrom` skips a row outside them), and `holdEffectsFrom` still
 * runs afterwards and is still the one that decides: the port pushes a bound
 * only when it is finite, which is what makes the narrowed read and the
 * unnarrowed one the same answer on a call with no cursor.
 *
 * ⚑ `readable` IS A CLAIM ABOUT WHETHER THE RECORD WAS READ, not about whether
 * this function threw (reviewer's repair 2, lap 4). An unreachable record gets
 * the catch's shape with its own reason, exactly as an absent sqlite file did:
 * "I read the holding record and it is empty" is a different sentence from "I
 * could not read it", and a caller must be able to tell them apart.

// other field is the canon record's own, copied: an amend that changes nothing
