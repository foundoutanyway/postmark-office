// THE OUTPUTS (POS-270, lane W). The hydration builds its rows in memory
// (src/world-graph-rows.mjs) and writes each output FROM them:
//   --to-store   the store's graph snapshot, 037/038, through graph-ingest's own
//                writer (PGHOST/PGDATABASE/PGUSER=law_ingester/PGPASSWORD) — what
//                the office reads, and what the tick writes;
//   --rows-out   the rows themselves as one JSON file (the graph's tables by name),
//                the fixture a test hands an office as WORLD_GRAPH_ROWS
//                (world-graph-snapshot.mjs § THE TEST FIXTURE SEAM).
// world.db is retired (lane W 3b): `--db` is refused by name, and `--no-db`
// is accepted and changes nothing, since writing no file is now the only way.
// Exit 0 every asked-for output written · 1 refused, stamped FAILED, or the
// store write missed · 2 --db asked for.
//
// The pattern is src/hydrate.mjs's, extended from tables-per-thing to
// nodes+edges: rebuild from scratch every run, stamp the as-of shas in `meta`,
// hold the graph to being an INDEX. Everything here is recomputable from the
// two checkouts at the two shas named in `meta`, so a snapshot may be deleted at
// any moment without losing a fact the town owns.
//
// Three rules shape the whole file:
//
//   ANOMALIES ARE RECORDED, NEVER FIXED. Where the directory tree claims a
//   containment the geometry will not support, the edge lands with
//   geometry_ok:false. Where a timetable names a stop that is no mark, the edge
//   lands with its dst verbatim. A hydrator that quietly repaired either would
//   be deleting the findings the store exists to surface.
//
//   THE DERIVER'S GATE LAW (§5.2, decided). Every deriver refuses or discloses
//   its absent inputs. Missing world clone, unreadable marks, a git history
//   that cannot be walked: REFUSED, named, nonzero, and the store's newest
//   snapshot is left untouched. Anything else absent is DISCLOSED — recorded in
//   meta.gates with the tables it leaves empty, printed loudly. And after the
//   build, any table a passing gate promised to fill is checked: an index that
//   silently served an empty table would be indistinguishable from an index
//   that had nothing to say.
//
//   EVERY EVENT IS JUDGED AT ITS OWN INSTANT. geometry_versions carries each
//   mark's geometry with a validity window derived from git history, so a lint
//   over historical events never re-decides history when a mark moves.

//    filing: it carries no claim, and it never moves again."

// the artifact the world's own fold emits — `WORLD/containment.json`, thrown
// away and rebuilt at every settlement, which is what keeps it from rotting the
// way a stored path does. Rows are `{ id, parent, chain }`; `parent: null`
// belongs to the world root alone, and `chain` is the spine outermost-LAST
// (nearest ancestor first).
//
// THE FALLBACK IS DELIBERATE AND LOUD. A clone from before the freeze carries no
// such file, and refusing to hydrate it would take the office down for an
// artifact that did not exist last week. So the absence falls back to the old
// directory derivation and SAYS SO — an ABSENT gate, a warning line, and

//     rows are `placementParent` over the ground — the same function the write
//     door places by.
//
//   `describes` — PREDICATION, and the freeze does not touch it. A predicated or
//     naming mark is its parent CONTINUED (SCHEMA.md's continuation law): it has
//     no footprint to be contained by anything and takes its subject from the
//     mark it is nested inside. That nesting is AUTHORSHIP, not a claim about
//     ground, so it stays directory-derived. (The world's mark-lint gate B draws

// `loadMarks` composes a relative tree for us, which is why the nodes table
// needed no change at all when coordinates went relative. This walk does not go
// through `loadMarks`: it reads old blobs with `parseRecord`, which hands back
// the record exactly as it is SPELLED — and on a relative tree that spelling is
// an offset from the parent's centre. Uncomposed, a hearth room's version row
// would state its position as (-2, -1) and then correctly report that it
// disagrees with the tree.
//
// So the composition happens here too, per commit, against the ancestor chain AS
// IT STOOD AT THAT COMMIT — the tense law applied to the frame itself. The
// migration commit is the instant the numbers changed meaning; a version row on
// either side of it must be read in its own commit's frame, or the migration
// reads as 282 marks teleporting.
