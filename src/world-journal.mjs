// world-journal.mjs — THE SINGLE LOG. Every world mutation, one append-only row.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// POS-5 slice 1 of the world-runtime ladder (§2, and §8's storage ruling (b)).
// Today a `world_leave_mark` is a git ceremony: lease a worktree out of the
// pool, take the town lock plus a household lock, check out `draft/<household>`,
// write a file, commit, push. The ceremony's only job was ever to let git absorb
// writes it does not need before the save. Behind `WORLD_SINGLE_LOG=1` a mark is
// ONE INSERT into the table below, and the drain (slice 2) is what git hears
// about.
//
// The plan's own words for the thing this file is: "Source 3 — the live journal.
// The dynamic DB's single append-only log: everything declared since the last
// save. SUBJECT · ACTION · optional OBJECT · EFFECT. Truncated at the save after
// write-down. The ONLY thing that moves between saves."
//
// ── THE TWO LAWS THIS FILE ANSWERS ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `the-witnessed-line` (world main, tier constitution) — a deliberate RED
// planted 2026-08-22 for this slice to flip:
//
//   "Every line of the log carries its witnesses at write time — an anchor and
//    an offset: where the actor stood, relative to what, at that instant."
//
// `the-anchor` (same planting) says what an anchor may be:
//
//   "An anchor is a mark, an entity, or the world — a held thing rides its
//    holder as a rider rides the deck; what may anchor where is class contract."
//
// So `at_anchor/at_dx/at_dy` is not a coordinate pair with extra steps. A raw
// world x,y is a photograph: it cannot survive the thing it was measured against
// moving, which is the whole failure §8 catalogues four times over (the rider,
// the held thing, the emission on the deck, the stale occupancy). An anchor plus
// an offset survives it, because the anchor moves and the offset does not.
//
// ── WHY ONE SCHEMA FOR BOTH LAWS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Keemin ruled §8 storage as (b): frame-transition events ride THIS log, not a
// frame column on dynamic.db entities. That is why `class` exists as a column
// and why a row's `at` is already anchor-relative — a reparenting is a row whose
// EFFECT is "the anchor changed", and it needs no shape this file does not
// already have. Slice 1 builds the corridor and proves a frame row replays; it
// does NOT re-point walk/enter/exit, because that is the position-core rewrite
// §8 explicitly defers ("NOT a land-it-today job").
//
// ── THE COLUMNS, AND WHICH ARE RULED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Ruled (the row schema, 2026-08-23): seq · crossing · actor · at (anchor +
// offset) · witnesses · class · payload.
//
// Three more come straight from §2's own grammar — the log is SUBJECT · ACTION ·
// OBJECT? · EFFECT?, and `actor` is only the SUBJECT of it: `action`, `object`,
// `effect`. Two more are operational and named here rather than smuggled:
// `household` (the drain's scoping key — §3 writes drafts down to
// `draft/<household>`, and the read's exposure scope is the same word) and
// `written_at` (the wall clock, beside `crossing`'s town clock, because a
// replay that cannot say when is a replay that cannot be checked).
//
// ── REPLAYABLE IN PRINCIPLE, TODAY ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `readJournal` + `replayDrafts` are written in this slice even though the drain
// that will consume them is slice 2's. A write path whose reader does not exist
// yet is a write path nobody has proven can be read back, and the whole point of
// an append-only log is that the log is the truth. `replayDrafts` is pure: rows
// in, the §1c delta shape out, no store and no git.
//
// Env: WORLD_SINGLE_LOG=1 — the write path becomes the journal. OFF is
// byte-identical to today, which is a falsifier, not a hope.

 *
 * This function used to INSERT a sqlite `journal` row and then hand the row to
 * a fire-and-forget Postgres queue. The INSERT is gone, and with it the only
 * thing that made the fire-and-forget defensible. Two sentences in this repo
 * said so before the deletion existed, and they are the whole argument:
 *
 *   world2-pen.mjs § shadowWrite — the queue is "fire-and-forget for the
 *   caller … acceptable ONLY because the sqlite journal is still the SoT on an
 *   unflipped lane"
 *
 *   world2-acts.mjs § WRITE DISCIPLINE — "the cutover rewrite awaits the
 *   insert and refuses at the door instead"
 *
 * So the write is AWAITED and a failure THROWS. A door whose act cannot reach
 * the record refuses; it never answers 200 over an act no store holds. That is
 * the cost of a store-of-record town and it was ruled with the cost named: when
 * Postgres is down these doors answer 503 where they used to answer 200 on the
 * strength of a sqlite row nobody was going to read.
 *
 * ⚑ ASYNC NOW, AND THE UN-AWAITED FORM IS SILENT — a caller that forgets the
 * `await` gets a Promise whose `.seq` is `undefined` and whose rejection is
 * unhandled, which reads downstream as a successful write of nothing. Every
 * call site awaits, and the deletion's own falsifier pins that.
 *
 * ⚑ `db` IS STILL TAKEN AND STILL UNUSED HERE. The doors pass `null` since
 * POS-269: each used to open the dynamic store in write mode only to hand the
 * handle over, and that open was a WAL pragma, the whole DDL and a lock on every
 * say, walk, crossing, ride, stance and mark, taken for nothing. The parameter
 * stays because some forty test and tool call sites pass a store positionally.
 * The arena is the one caller that still WRITES sqlite, through its own named
 * function below.

  // BODY — so writing an unstaked declaration there would publish a resident's
  // private sentence permanently, and no row policy on `claims` could reach it.
  // That is the whole privacy promise of Phase 5.6.

  // deed is not, and the row rides on the draft (`data._deferred_act`) until a
  // stake makes the mark public — dated at the putting-forward, which is when
  // the world actually witnessed anything. The predicate is deliberately
  // narrow: ONLY an unstaked mark-class declaration defers.
  //
  // ⚑ THE PRIVATE ARM RIDES THIS QUEUE, not a second one, and the reason is

/**
 * THE FLIPPED WRITE — the pen-flip design's §3 ordering, per lane (D1).
 *
 * Postgres commits FIRST and is awaited; on failure this THROWS
 * PenUnreachableError and NOTHING has been written anywhere — the door owes
 * the resident the ruled refusal (D2): "the office's record cannot be
 * reached — nothing was written, and nothing was lost."
 *
 * After the commit, the sqlite journal receives the same row as the REVERSE
 * mirror (D3) — best-effort, after the record, never with a vote. While it
 * holds, every 1.0 read (the door guards included) stays valid, which is what
 * lets a lane flip before the R3 read ports land: the ports gate rule 6's
 * DELETION, not this flag. A reverse write that fails is loud and the parity
 * falsifier's reverse arm reds at the next check.
 *
 * THE MARK LANE IS NO LONGER REFUSED HERE (wired 2026-09-04, runbook C6). It
 * was refused by name for UNREADINESS — "its candle half must ride penWrite's
 * own transaction" — and that is now what happens: a mark-class row carries a
 * `claimFn` and a household resolver into `penWrite`, so the act and its claim
 * commit on one client in one transaction, and an unstaked declaration rides
 * the same client with `act: false` so its body never reaches the table that
 * leaves the box. The refusal is removed in the same change that wires the
 * path, because a refusal left standing over a wired path is a lie in the other
 * direction.
 *
 * The ARENA lane is refused BY RULING, not by unreadiness (founder, 2026-08-29,
 * the birthday party's own night: "we can just keep the arena on sqlite for
 * now"). The combat machinery is scheduled to be rebuilt hardened and
 * 2.0-native rather than ported, so its lane stays sqlite-first deliberately —
 * no read port exists, no reverse-mirror deadline applies to it, and a
 * `W2_PEN=all` sweep must not carry it along by accident. Lifting this refusal
 * is a founder ruling plus the arena read ports, together.
 *
 * "No reverse-mirror deadline applies to it" was a sentence this file asserted
 * and no mechanism kept: `MIRROR_EXPIRES` was one date for the whole store, so
 * the parity falsifier would have reded the arena on 2026-10-01 with everything
 * else (the cutover runbook §8 named it; DEC-2 ruled it 2026-08-29 evening). It
 * is now true where it is checked: `LANE_MIRROR.arena.expires` is null in
 * src/world2-acts.mjs, carrying this same ruling in its own words.
 *
 * THE TWO REFUSALS WERE NOT THE SAME KIND, and the expiry is where the
 * difference bit. `mark` was refused for UNREADINESS, so it was governed by its
 * backstop exactly like the wired lanes — DEC-2, verbatim: "a lane in
 * `FLIP_REFUSED` by ruling is exempt; a lane refused by unreadiness is not."
 * Being un-wired must never be the thing that buys a lane immortality. With the
 * mark lane wired only the ruled refusal is left, which is the state DEC-2
 * describes: this table now holds exactly the lanes that are exempt BY RULING,
 * and `LANE_MIRROR.arena.expires` is null for the same reason and in its own
 * words (src/world2-acts.mjs). `mark` keeps its ordinary expiry.

// ── THE LANE HOOK · an act the sqlite journal never held ────────────────────
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES, stated as the class rather than the instance. The live
// lane's law is that `acts` is the town's event log — "every act in the town
// belongs to exactly one lane" (gold §1) — and the mirror above delivers on
// that for every act that takes a journal row. It is silent about the acts that
// do not, and there are three of them: a SAY (its pen is the voices log), a
// HOLDING (its pen is `attachments`), and a WALK under WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2 (its
// pen is `movements`; the journal arm in walk-exec.mjs is the flag-OFF lane and
// has not run on dev since movement-v2 shipped). Nothing said, carried or
// walked since the seed reached World 2.0, and `/world2/say` answered over the
// crossing-save's crystallized record alone.
//
// ── WHY THESE DO NOT SIMPLY GROW A JOURNAL ROW ─────────────────────────────
//
// It was the first thing tried and it is the wrong shape, for two reasons that
// point the same way:
//
//   · THE JOURNAL IS BEING DELETED. It is 1.0's live layer, and rule 6 removes
//     it at cutover. Adding three lanes to the thing we are retiring is
//     lift-and-shift wearing a migration's coat (rule 1) — and `journal_seq`
//     is documented in 001_tables.sql as the SHADOW-ERA pairing key that "DIES
//     AT CUTOVER". A lane mirrored with no seq is already in its final shape;
//     a lane given a seq would have to be un-given one later.
//   · IT WOULD CHANGE 1.0. The drain crystallizes every non-mark row into
//     `STATE/log/<N>.journal.jsonl` in the world repo (world-drain.mjs §
//     logLine, which filters only for CLASS_MARK). So a journal row for every
//     say would put a new public git artifact on a live shared world, today,
//     to buy World 2.0 nothing it cannot have without it.
//
// So these lanes keep their own pens — untouched, still 1.0's truth — and this
// is the SECOND consumer of the same fact, exactly as `emissionFromVoice` is
// the second consumer of a voice. Same fire-and-forget contract as `mirrorAct`,
// same loudness on failure, same death date.
//
// ── AND THE ROW SHAPE IS NOT REINVENTED ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `normalizeRow` is the one that `appendJournal` uses, which is what makes "a
// say and a leave-mark are the same kind of row in `acts`" true by construction
// rather than by two normalizers agreeing.
/**
 * Mirror an act whose pen is not this table. `entry` is `appendJournal`'s own
 * vocabulary, so a lane describes its act exactly as a journalled lane would.
 *
 * Returns the mirror's promise (the caller may await it — an exec that is about
 * to `process.exit` MUST) or undefined when the mirror is off.
 */
export function mirrorLaneAct(entry = {}) {

}

// ── THE ESCAPE, AND WHY IT IS WORSE THAN THE GAP ────────────────────────────
//
// The say gap is a lane that never calls `appendJournal`. This is its twin, and
// the twin is the dangerous one BECAUSE THE LANE LOOKS CLOSED: `crossing-exec`
// and `walk-exec` both call `appendJournal` — every enter, every exit, every
// flag-off walk — and both are SUBPROCESSES whose last line is
//
//     const answer = (obj) => { console.log(JSON.stringify(obj)); process.exit(0); };
//
// `mirrorAct` is fire-and-forget by contract (world2-acts.mjs § WRITE
// DISCIPLINE): it queues the INSERT and returns before a connection is even
// opened. `process.exit(0)` is immediate and unconditional — it does not drain
// the event loop — so the act died in the child with the pg socket, and the
// console.error that the module promises on failure died with it too. A lost
// act, silently, from a lane whose code reads as mirrored.
//
// LATENT RATHER THAN LIVE, and the difference is only luck: `/etc/postmark-
// office-dev.env` carries no WORLD2_* variable (verified 2026-08-28), so the
// mirror has never been on in a process that spawns these execs. It would have
// begun losing enter/exit acts the hour the flag was set.
//
// THE FIX IS THE CONTRACT MADE EXPLICIT rather than the contract changed: the
// mirror stays fire-and-forget for the request path (an in-process caller has
// an event loop that outlives it, which is the whole reason the queue is
// allowed to be async), and any caller ABOUT TO END ITS PROCESS awaits this
// first. That is the one place the difference matters.
//
// BOUNDED, and the bound is not a detail. These execs run under the town flock;
// an unbounded wait on an unreachable Postgres would hold the lock for the
// TCP timeout and stall the crossing behind it — trading a lost act for a
// wedged town, which is the worse of the two. So the wait is capped and a cap
// that is REACHED is loud: the operator learns the mirror is behind, and the
// parity falsifier reds at the next check, which is exactly the alarm the
// missing console.error should have raised in the first place.

 *
 * ── THE FREEZE, 2026-08-25 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A sited/parcel record used to land on open ground at the root
 * (`ROOT_PREFIX/<slug>/`) on the reasoning that the settlement re-homed it by
 * geometry afterwards anyway. The freeze DELETED the re-home pass — "The
 * settlement writes a mark once; nothing moves it after" — so where this door
 * files is now where the mark lives forever, and the law says where that is:
 *
 *   "New marks are filed by identity — WORLD/marks/<household>/<slug>/"
 *
 * Predicated/naming still take the directory of the mark they describe. That
 * nesting is AUTHORSHIP — a predicate is its parent continued (the continuation
 * law) — never a claim about ground, so the freeze does not touch it. The
 * world's own gate B draws the same line and flags it at mark-lint §6 as its
 * reading of a sentence the law states without the qualification.
 *
 * The two frames agree by construction, which is what makes this a filing change
 * and not a geometry change: `WORLD/marks/<by>/<slug>/` has no mark.md above it,
 * so the loader frames it on the world origin; `ROOT_PREFIX/<slug>/` is framed on
 * the root mark's centre, and the root's centre IS the world origin
 * (`at: { x: 0, y: 0 }` in WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/mark.md). Same digits.
 *
 * ── GATE A BEFORE GATE B, and this is the half that is easy to miss ─────────
 *
 *   "A mark's directory is its historical filing: it carries no claim, and it
 *    NEVER MOVES AGAIN."
 *
 * Filing by identity is the rule for a mark that does not have a filing yet. A
 * mark that HAS one keeps it, and an amend is a new declaration rather than a
 * move — so `publishedPathOf` is consulted first, and its answer wins. Without
 * that, amending any mark filed before the freeze would send the record to a new
 * directory while the old file stood: two files, one id, and the world's own
 * gate A refusing the result. That is the publish+re-home wedge (#1862) in a new
 * coat, and the freeze exists partly to kill it.
 *
 * The caller supplies the lookup because only the caller can see a tree. Where
 * one is not supplied — the resident-facing `dir`, whose door cannot cheaply
 * resolve a published mark's directory — the answer is the id path, and
 * `writeDownHousehold` is the backstop that keeps the file where it already is.

// `ls-tree` at the sha and cached on it — the tree is immutable at a commit, so
// a cache nobody can invalidate is impossible here.
//
// ── THE FOSSIL MANIFEST IS THE FIRST ANSWER (the freeze, 2026-08-25) ─────────
//
//   "A mark's directory is its historical filing: it carries no claim, and it
//    never moves again."
//
// `WORLD/filing-freeze.json` maps every mark alive on the freeze date to the
// path it was filed at, keyed by FULL ID. It is minted once and never
// regenerated, so it is the exact, static answer to "where does this mark
// already live" — one JSON read, no tree walk, and no ambiguity.
//
// WHY IT HAD TO COME FIRST, and it is not only about speed. The `ls-tree` index
// below is keyed by leaf SLUG, and a slug is unique per AUTHOR, not per tree:
// two households may both keep a `the-lamp`. That index resolved an ambiguous
// slug to NOTHING, on the reasoning — quoted from the comment this replaces —
// that "the row falls back to the root-level path … and the drain re-homes by
// geometry at the save regardless". The freeze DELETED that re-homer. A
// fossil mark whose slug another household shares would now fall back to a
// root-level path that nothing will ever move, and gate A would refuse it at the
// next lint. The manifest is keyed by id, so it cannot be ambiguous.
//
// The manifest carries directories; a caller wants the record, so `/mark.md` is
// appended here rather than at four call sites.
