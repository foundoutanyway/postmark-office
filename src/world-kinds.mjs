// world-kinds.mjs — THE KIND DOOR: marks made into a holder, and taken and given
// by kind (LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O2). It replaces #499's label doors
// (world-units.mjs, which #608 ships dark): the same hold lane, the same queue,
// the same `units:*` acts, but every move names its `kind` — a class id — and
// never a `label`, so the fold keeps the two apart (world-stacks § foldUnits).
// The adjudication is kind-holding.mjs's, pure; this file reads the record,
// asks the reach, serializes on the hold queue and writes the act.
//
// WHICH ACT A CALL IS — read off its arguments (and, from the apex, its verb):
//
//   leave-mark { kind, count, to }           make: n marks of the kind into a holder
//   take { from?, kind?, count }             take by kind, or pot luck with no kind;
//                                            `from` omitted: the one holder in reach
//   give { kind?, count, to }                give: to a resident or into a holder
//   refill { thing: <holder>, kind, count }  a class's afforded action, where its
//                                            class declares one (the Candy Bowl)
//
// THE TRANSFER IS ONE EDGE (11:12–11:14; 16:02 item 7): a give and a take are
// one act each, with two ends (`payload.edge`: giver and receiver), and both
// ends must permit it — the giver holds it, the receiver has room, and a holder
// that is not `open` refuses another household at the door.
