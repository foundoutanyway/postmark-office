// world-movement.mjs — STAGE D, the movement cutover. All of it behind
// `WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2=1`; with the flag off nothing in this file runs and every
// door answers byte-for-byte what it answered before.
//
// Three sentences from the proposal become code here, and each one replaces a
// derivation the office had been doing for itself:
//
//   1. A CARRIER'S POSITION IS f(TIMETABLE, CLOCK). Not a walk-ledger line that
//      the pen files on her behalf at cast-off. `tools/vessel.mjs` has held this
//      arithmetic since 2026-08-07 and the office never consumed it — it read
//      her sailing line out of the ledger like a resident's and compared
//      passengers against it field by field (`ridesTheVessel`). That comparison
//      is the line-mirroring being retired: true only for as long as the pen
//      keeps filing passengers with byte-identical records, which is a
//      coincidence of the writer, not a fact about the world.
//
//   2. RIDING IS A FRAME, NOT A DECLARATION (ruled 2026-08-10, and it REPLACES
//      this file's first answer). An earlier build asked residents to say "I am
//      aboard" and validated the claim against where they stood at the cast-off
//      instant. The frame law deletes all of it: your frame is the deepest
//      carrier you are within, crossing the boundary is the consent, and there
//      is no cast-off instant to be present at — you are carried if your frame
//      is the carrier when it moves. The machinery lives in `world-frames.mjs`;
//      this file is where the doors reach it.
//
//   3. AN EMISSION RIDES ITS SOURCE. A voice's frame is its speaker; a speaker's
//      frame may be a carrier; FRAMES COMPOSE. A shared deck is one room by
//      construction — see `heardFromV2`, and the INTERIM block in voices.mjs it
//      supersedes. This generalized for free when attachments became frames,
//      which is the sign the law was the right size.
//
// THE ENGINE COMES FROM A REF, NOT THE WORKING TREE. Same discipline (and the
// same helper) as `dynamic-entities.mjs`: the world clone's checkout belongs to
// the write pen and routinely sits on a household draft branch, so importing
// movement arithmetic from the tree would mean the office computed where the
// boat is from whatever the last writer left behind.

// NOTHING FROM `node:fs` OR `dynamic-store` IS IMPORTED HERE ANY MORE, and the
// absence is the receipt: `existsSync`, `openDynamic`, `dynamicDbPath` and
// `readMovements` existed in this module for `storedDepartures` alone, which
// reads `acts` now (POS-154). A module that keeps the handle to a store it no
// longer reads is one edit away from reading it again.

// endpoint at arrival landed inside her footprint. Keemin's ruling 1 —
// "decouple the geometric movement of the Post Office from the residents'
// ability to ride it" — makes that answer unreachable for a rider by
// construction: you enter through a wharf a hundred kilometres from her hull,
// your walk record ends at that wharf, and no fold over your departures will
// ever put you inside her. So the question moves to the record that actually
// knows: the enter-exit ledger, which is the office's one answer to "what are
// you inside" and has been since the pair shipped.
//
//   "wherever a resident boards … they can take it to their destination at Post
//    Office speed as if it was going directly there"
//   "we need the residents sitting still in a Post Office interior"
//
// So: your standpoint IS the hull's, you are not moving (nothing you declared is
// in progress — the timer is not a leg), and THERE IS NO INTERPOLATION TOWARD
// THE DESTINATION. That last one is not an omission; it is ruling 6 falling out
// of one branch. A lobby has no intermediate points.

// source the three world-repo readers have (`tools/movement-records.mjs §
// storeRecords`, and `boarding-flip-disclosure.mjs` /
// `position-seed-manifest.mjs` through it). It was written from
// `dynamic.db/movements` — the REVERSE-MIRROR copy, stamped
// `"source":"dynamic.db/movements"` on all 2,857 of its lines — so when G1
// removed that mirror the record would have stopped and the readers fallen back
// to the frozen ledger era.
//
// This is the same record rendered from `acts`, through POS-154's one road, so
// the swap is a change of WRITER and not of meaning. It emits world.db's
// `events` row shape — exactly what `dynamic-entities.mjs § readMovements`
// emitted — so `mergedDepartureEvents`, `governingAt`, `buildSave` and every
// replay read the two eras through one vocabulary and the seam stays invisible.
//
// ⚑ THE SWAP IS WIRED (POS-156 part 0, 2026-09-22). Both write paths that
// rendered the live era from the mirror rendered it from here:
// `tools/crossing-save.mjs`'s `<N>.jsonl` half and `src/dynamic-entities.mjs §
// refreshEntities` (retired with the entities table, POS-269). `crossing-save --check` diffs the rendered window against
// the file on `RECORD_READ_FIELDS`; `test/pos-156-the-record-is-written-from-
// the-store.test.mjs` pins which table each write path reads.
//
// IT WAS HELD FOR TWO LANES, and the reason is worth keeping: POS-196 built
// this renderer and could not wire it because the register held no departure
// INSTANT — `acts.at` was the MIRROR's clock, taken after the resident
// declared, and `acts.crossing` is a different read that reconstructs the true
// instant exactly ZERO times across the record's own 2,808 live door-written
// lines. `at` is the first field every world reader reads. POS-198 closed it:
// `world.mjs § walkViaOffice` reads the declaration clock ONCE and hands the
// same string to both pens, so `acts.at` is the departure's own instant. Rows
// written before that carry the mirror's clock; `world2/tools/
// backfill-departures.mjs` was always correct on this point (`at: m.at`).
