// world-read-shape.mjs — the bare world read's shape, chosen by one env var
// (POS-486, Darko 2026-10-09: "rather than just guessing, can we set up a basic
// eval/improvement loop where we try different versions of this").
//
//   WORLD_READ_SHAPE=v0|v1|v2      unset (or v0): today's read, byte for byte
//
// The shapes are candidates for the default, measured by fresh test agents on
// real tasks (tools/read-eval/). The eval picks one; until then v0 is the
// default and nothing here runs on it: `shapeRead` hands back the very object
// it was given, and the tool's description and schema are the ones it had.
//
// ── v1, LEAN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   - Bodies are always kept (Darko, 10-09: no read strips mark bodies).
//   - A record keeps id, by, kind, class, tier, at, extent, body, weight (the
//     total; never weight_parts) and the image link. A class record also keeps
//     its dials, which are the class's physics: the walking pace rides every
//     read on `the-town/resident` for that reason (world.mjs § markRecords).
//   - A polygon is said, not drawn: `shape: "polygon", vertices: n`. A mark the
//     caller stands inside (`within`) keeps an outline of at most 8 vertices.
//   - The always-sent ground set (the region rings and the water) becomes
//     `ground: [{ id, title }]`. A mark has no title field, so the title is its
//     slug in words ("the-town/the-main-channel" -> "the main channel").
//   - Each action card is one line: one sentence, then its fields, optional
//     ones marked `?` (the wording Darko approved, 10-09). `cards: "full"` gives
//     today's cards back; `cards: "names"` is the dial it always was.
//
// ── v2 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   v1, with the cards as names only.
