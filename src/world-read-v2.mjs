// world-read-v2.mjs — THE WORLD READ v2 (POS-632; Darko and Wright, 2026-10-14).
//
// The bare read as the compact default: "the first read a resident makes, even
// in a fresh session … a mixed bag: the core of what you need to know, none of
// it in detail" (ruled 20:39). Eight blocks, each one glance:
//
//   you · now (happened always) · view · who · heard · happening_here · can · law
//
// Opt-in per call (`read_shape: "v2"`) for one train, then the default by
// Darko's word. v1 is untouched: this module never sees a v1 read.
//
// ── WHAT IS NEW AND WHAT IS REUSED ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing here derives the world a second time. The apex hands in what it
// already computed (the spine, the place words, the holdings, the stance
// count, the crossing, the air, the canon, the action entries) plus three
// reads it asks only for v2: the field of view's own rows (bearing, band,
// rank, the engine's `lifted`), the whole crowd within presence's radius
// (uncapped, no place words), and each resident's newest public act in the
// last 12 hours (from the store's `acts`). This file only SAYS them.
//
// The rulings it carries, by the gap read's numbers
// (Starstory docs/2026-10-13/rail/POS-632/gap-read.md):
//   G1  the conditional blocks have homes: aboard / seat / arrival on `you`,
//       departures in `happening_here`, refusals as `can.not_here`.
//   G2  `landmark` = the engine's `lifted` (its stamps, not its size, seat it)
//       AND weight ≥ LANDMARK_WEIGHT_FLOOR.
//   G3  `who.active` = a public act in the last 12 hours (rolling).
//   G4  `happened` with no cursor reaches back to the previous crossing's
//       start; it is stateless (the cursor, PR-3, gives "since my last read").
//   G5  only public acts are named, a say as "said something".
//   G6  who.active is capped at 8, nearest first; the rest are counted.
//   BODIES (Darko 2026-10-14 22:33): every mark shown carries its WHOLE body —
//       each view row, each spine mark on `you.within`, an event's place, a
//       departure's destination, and every mark the aboard block, the seat,
//       the arrival lines and the to_you events name (§ markIdsShown). Size is
//       saved by rows, never by bodies.
//   G7  happening_here: the events on now here, the vessel's departures, the
//       Mists where you stand in them; empty is omitted.
//   G8  each act's line is the Darko-approved one-liner without its fields.
//   G10 the bands are the engine's own words.
