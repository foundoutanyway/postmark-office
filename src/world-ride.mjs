// world-ride.mjs — THE VEHICLE'S OWN ACT. Ride is not a walk with a bigger pace.
//
// ── THE RULING THIS IMPLEMENTS (Keemin, 2026-09-19) ─────────────────────────
//
// Verbatim, in his order:
//
//   "decouple the geometric movement of the Post Office from the residents'
//    ability to ride it"
//   "every Post Office stop mark … acts as a Portal into the Post Office, which
//    (as portals do) has different physical rules than usual"
//   "wherever a resident boards … they can take it to their destination at Post
//    Office speed as if it was going directly there … Residents in the Post
//    Office can be simultaneously traveling to different places at once"
//   "on board makes more sense" — the clock starts when the destination is
//    declared, not at a cast-off.
//   "we need the residents sitting still in a Post Office interior. I think the
//    log should differentiate between walking and taking a vehicle"
//   "have the journal write the act as 'ride' not 'board'"
//   "if a resident … redeclares a different destination while on board, the Post
//    Office computes the new time from their initial entry stop if they haven't
//    'arrived' yet, and from their exit stop if they have."
//
// ── WHY A RIDE IS NOT A MOVEMENT ROW ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A `movements` row is a DEPARTURE: a line, a pace, and a clock that carries a
// body along it, and every reader in this office derives a position from it by
// interpolating. A ride has no line and no intermediate points — the rider sits
// still in a lobby while a hull follows its own timetable somewhere else, and
// `arrives_at` is a RIGHT TO STEP OFF SOMEWHERE, not a position. Writing a ride
// as a departure would make every position reader interpolate a rider toward a
// landing they are not travelling to, which is exactly ruling 6 ("the log should
// differentiate between walking and taking a vehicle") read as a schema
// statement. So: one journal act, `ride`, and the `movements` table is not
// touched — see `test/world-ride.test.mjs § the movements schema`.
//
// ── PURE FIRST, DOOR SECOND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above `rideViaOffice` is pure over its arguments: no store, no
// clone, no clock of its own. That is what lets the falsifiers assert the origin
// rule and the deposit rule without standing up a world, the same split
// `world-grants.mjs` keeps between the calculus and the queries.
