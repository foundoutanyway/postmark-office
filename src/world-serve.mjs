// world-serve.mjs — Stage 1's serving layer: office world reads answered from
// the world graph snapshot (POS-270), behind two flags, with the fold diffing
// beside them.
//
//   WORLD_STORE_SHADOW=1   compute BOTH answers, serve the fold's, log every
//                          disagreement. Zero behaviour change for residents.
//                          This is the mode that runs on the box first.
//   WORLD_STORE_READS=1    serve the STORE's answer where it is eligible.
//   (neither)              the store is never opened. Not "opened and ignored" —
//                          never opened: `servedRead` returns the fold on its
//                          first line, before a stat, a git call or a counter.
//
// Both flags on is the transitional rung, and it is well defined: the store
// answers, the fold verifies. The box ladder is off → shadow → watch → serve.
//
// ── WHAT MAY BE SERVED, AND WHY THE GUARD IS IN CODE ────────────────────────
//
// The world graph indexes PUBLISHED MAIN and nothing else — and since the world
// runtime ladder's §1c (2026-08-22) so does every read: the fold path serves
// canon to anonymous, visitor and author alike, and a household's drafts reach
// their own author as a delta instead. So the two paths index the same world by
// construction now, not by agreement.
//
// The keyed refusal below therefore no longer MIRRORS a branch choice the fold
// makes — the fold makes none. It stays as a belt: `servedRead` still takes a
// `key`, and if a future household-scoped read is ever wired into this lane, it
// falls through to the fold rather than quietly collecting main from the store.
// The one live caller (`place_words`) passes `key: null` by construction, so the
// arm fires for nobody today. Retire it when either the key parameter leaves
// `servedRead` or a keyed read is deliberately admitted here.
//
// The second half of eligibility is FRESHNESS, and it is exact rather than
// approximate: the store may answer only when `meta.as_of_world` is the very
// commit the fold would have served. Not "recent", not "within a crossing" —
// the same sha. A store one commit behind main is a store that cannot answer
// identically, and this file's whole discipline is that a read either matches
// the fold or falls through to it, loudly.
//
// ── WHAT THE STORE STILL CANNOT ANSWER ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A query may return `CANNOT_ANSWER` for its own reasons — see
// `pointAnswerable`, where six water marks carrying polygon rings that the
// hydrator records only as a VERTEX COUNT make every point inside their
// bounding boxes unanswerable. That fall-through is not a wart to be tidied
// away: it is the mechanism working. A read that the store cannot answer
// identically goes to the fold, is counted, and says which reason.

 * May the store answer a question asked AT A POINT?

 * wrong — and a difference nobody can explain is worse than a fall-through
 * everybody can count.
 *
 *   irregular-shape-in-play  Six water marks carry `points:` rings. The engine
 *     tests a point against the RING; the store holds only the vertex count, so
 *     it would answer by bounding box. Refused whenever the point lies in any
 *     ring-carrying mark's bbox — sound (a ring never reaches outside its own
 *     bbox, so no answer changes outside one) and complete (both the point test
 *     and the nest's `marksContain` go analytic once no irregular mark is in
 *     range). This is the fall-through that actually fires; the honest fix is a
 *     hydrator that stores the ring, and that is Stage 1's next commit, not this
 *     one's.
 *
 *   equal-extent-tie  `containmentChain` sorts the containing marks by extent
 *     AREA and V8's sort is stable, so two containing marks of equal area leave
 *     the innermost decided by ITERATION ORDER. The fold's order is its loader's
 *     and the store's is SQLite's, and neither promises the other anything.
 *
 *   nearest-tie  The place-word FALLBACK — the branch that runs only when
 *     nothing contains the point — picks the nearest sited mark with a strict
 *     `<`, so an exact distance tie keeps whichever came first: the same
 *     iteration-order coin toss, on a grid town where equidistant 25×25 parcels
 *     are an ordinary arrangement rather than a freak one. `checkNearest` is the
 *     caller saying whether that branch is actually in play. It was briefly
 *     checked unconditionally, on the theory that reasoning about when the
 *     fallback fires invites a subtle bug; the spike answered that: exact ties
 *     are common enough away from any containing mark that the unconditional
 *     check refused a third of all points, most of them points where the
 *     fallback would never have run. A guard that vetoes what it was not
 *     guarding is not caution, it is a store that never serves.
