// world-settlement.mjs — THE WORLD EVERYONE READS: THE NEWEST SETTLEMENT,
// MINUS WHAT HAS BEEN OPPOSED (POS-359; Darko's rulings R1, R2, R3, R5, R9, R10
// and R16, docs/2026-10-04/design-notes/world-reads-the-store-rulings.md, as
// AMENDED 10-04: silence publishes everywhere; governance takes away).
//
// ── WHAT IS SERVED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A settlement is every cleared mark minus every opposed one (R5). The clearing
// seals the cleared half as a snapshot (054/064, POS-357); the opposed half is
// read NOW, from the stance rows in the store, so an opposition takes effect at
// once (R16) and never waits for the next clearing.
//
//   1. WHICH SETTLEMENT. `S<n>` is a `settlements` row, and the row names its
//      snapshot (065 `snapshot_id`). The default is the newest row that names
//      one. The NUMBER is the settlements side's (054's header: "which snapshot
//      is S<n> is the settlements side's"): today the keeper's tag, read in by
//      the office tick; a row per clearing when POS-362 writes the settlement act.
//
//   2. ITS WORLD. `world_snapshot_folds` caches the snapshot's computed World by
//      the snapshot's digest (R1: "built outside it, by the office on first
//      read"). On a miss the office derives it from the snapshot's SOURCES, the
//      one derivation `--verify` runs (src/world-snapshot.mjs § snapshotFoldArgs,
//      Darko's POS-410 ruling): the world's engine at law_sha, the marks in their
//      filing order, the law and terrain at law_sha, the stakes replayed from
//      the town at the ledger position, the households from the register at the
//      seal through the town's own resolver. Then it keeps the result.
//
//   3. ITS WORDS (POS-362; Darko 2026-10-08, option A). The opposed half is a
//      source of the settlement like its marks: the seal records the newest
//      stance act (069 `stance_through`), and the settlement's World is its
//      sources folded WITH the words standing at the seal (§ wordsAtSeal: the
//      acts up to stance_through, on the versions that stood at the seal's
//      window). That World is what `world_snapshot_folds` keeps under the
//      digest (which covers stance_through), what `--verify` re-derives, and
//      what an asked `?settlement=S<n>` serves: its own seal's words only. A
//      snapshot with no stance_through (sealed before 069, back-filled) folds
//      with none, which is what it published.
//
//   4. MINUS THE OPPOSED SINCE. The newest World (no settlement asked) takes the
//      words standing NOW, at once (R16). The absolute vetoes only: the town's opposed
//      word, and a parcel holder's opposed word on a mark over their own ground,
//      each on the mark's CURRENT version (an amendment reopens every word,
//      R14). They are not subtracted here. The settlement's own arguments are
//      folded AGAIN with today's words beside them, so the world's own return path
//      carries them (R10: "so the existing return path carries it"): the
//      subtree, the escrow guard (an opposed mark with open stakes stands until
//      they unwind) and `returned[]`, every one the engine's. The town's words
//      go in as `townWords` (consent.mjs § THE TOWN'S WORD, world#146); a
//      holder's as their parcel's consent word, the field the parcel veto has
//      always read (consent.mjs § the parcel domain). With the same absolute
//      vetoes standing now as at the seal, the served World IS the kept one,
//      byte for byte.
//
// 5. FROM THE CUTOVER ON (Darko, 2026-10-09 10:25 EDT). Items 3 and 4 apply
//    to a settlement numbered at or after TOWN_STANCE_CUTOVER. One below it,
//    or any while it is unset, is served with no stance at all, as git is
//    written from it (town-stance.mjs § stancesCountAt). DECIDED ONCE, AT THE
//    SEAL (072): the snapshot header records the decision (`stances`), and
//    every reader here reads that record and never recomputes it (§ stancesOf).
//
// Market opposition is not a veto (R16) and is not read here: it is
// density-weighted and the settlement's fold applies it (POS-369). A holder's
// welcomed is not read either: what it confers is the settlement's (POS-362),
// not "opposition at once".
