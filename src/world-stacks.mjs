// world-stacks.mjs — THE COUNTED HOLDING (WLD-27, for the w43 ship).
//
// `holds(holder → label, count)`: a live edge, ONE PER LABEL, whose holder is a
// resident or a chest. A stack is a count on an edge, not a crowd of marks
// (LOGOS/classes.md § Stacks, chests and candy). The rulings this file builds:
//
//   · Sitting A's build specification on WLD-27 (the issue's description).
//   · Wright, 2026-10-12T23:59Z and 2026-10-13T00:01Z: capacity 30 by default,
//     1..120; first stock min(30, capacity), once; refill is the creator's,
//     tops up to capacity, one act line, a full chest is a no-op; one edge per
//     label; a take or consume names its label when more than one is present,
//     otherwise refuses listing labels and counts — no draw, no implicit pick;
//     a counted unit carries no stakes.
//   · Wright, 2026-10-13T00:09Z: the identity field is `label`, never the mark's
//     `kind`; the candy class carries `labels: [{label, name, creator}]`, read
//     both ways; a chest whose maker has no label is admitted UNSTOCKED and
//     stocked once at the next settlement that finds the label.
//
// ── WHERE THE EDGE LIVES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// In `acts`, on the hold lane: class `holding`, actions `units:*`. The hold
// lane is already the record for who holds what (hold-edge.mjs), so a counted
// unit moving is one more face of the same act and needs no lane of its own,
// no new table and no migration. Every unit act carries `payload.moves`, a list
// of `{ from, to, label, n }` where `from`/`to` is a holder (a resident handle,
// or a chest's mark id `<by>/<slug>`) or null (a unit made by the town's stock
// or refill, or one that left the counts: consumed, or set down as a mark).
// The counts are the FOLD of those moves — derived, never stored, and never a
// second display count (the brief: "not … a second stored display count").
//
// `units:*` is outside guard-reads' ATTACHMENT_ACTIONS, so the who-holds-which-
// thing fold (`liveHolder`) never reads a unit act as a thing changing hands,
// and `latestDrop` (action === "drop") never reads a unit's set-down as a thing's.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS PURE: rows in, answers out. The door (world-hold.mjs) and
// the settlement tick (world2/tools/chest-stock.mjs) read the record and hand
// it in, for the reason world-hold.mjs gives for `declareHolding`: a falsifier
// must be able to put a chest at 27 without a store.
