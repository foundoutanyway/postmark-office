// world-stake.mjs — the world_stake / world_unstake doors (write-release P3 DRAFT).
//
// Append-shaped on purpose: a NEW module, so world.mjs only gains an import, a
// spread into WORLD_TOOLS, and two switch cases. (A parallel draft is adding walk
// to the same file; conflicts are the conductor's at review, so the surface each
// draft touches is kept as small as it can be.)
//
// THE LAW IS NOT HERE. Every rule — the balance clip, the no-cap ruling, the meep
// prohibition, ownership on unstake, the retirement gate — lives in the TOWN's own
// tools/world-stake.mjs, imported live from the town clone and never vendored. This
// is the same discipline votes.mjs follows for the ballot and hydrate.mjs for the
// balance fold, and it is the ops-desk lesson stated as code: shell the mint's own
// engine, never reimplement the mint's law in the door.
//
// What the DOOR adds, and only the door can:
//   1. Identity — a stake is signed by the office pen, so the door decides WHO the
//      caller may act as (handle-scoped, choose-or-bounce on a multi-resident key).
//   2. Mark existence — the ledger engine cannot see the world record; the door
//      holds the world clone, so it is the one place that can refuse a stake on a
//      mark that does not exist. Without this a resident could escrow real stamps
//      against an id nothing reads.
//   3. The lock — writes go through a subprocess under the ferry's flock, so a
//      stake append can never race a crossing's mint pass.

 *
 * A stake on a draft is two writes in one act, and their order is chosen (§ THE
 * BOUNDARY, ARRIVING ON ITS OWN, below): the promotion first, the ledger move
 * second, so the failure that CAN happen is the recoverable one. What was never
 * written was the recovery.
 *
 * Sophia held 0 and staked ✦1 on a commons mark. The promotion succeeded and
 * recorded `stake: 1` — the number ASKED. The ledger moved 0 and said so in its
 * own receipt ("your balance has no stamps free to stake", the town engine's
 * words). Nothing read that receipt, so the docket carried `stake: 1` behind a
 * mark holding nothing for nine hours, indistinguishable from a backed claim,
 * until the candle refused it at the close as nothing staked (window 184).
 * Correct judgment, wrong display, for nine hours.
 *
 * So the door closes its own loop: the act that made the promotion takes it
 * back, in the same act, and answers with the law rather than a receipt nobody
 * reads.
 *
 * ── ITS TWIN AT THE OTHER END ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *

 * version of this same rule — "a commons mark needs somebody's stamps behind
 * it" — applied at the close instead of at submit, and printing
 * `⚑ escrow: refused … nothing staked`. Two gates, one rule. They are pinned
 * against one fixture in `test/stake-held.test.mjs`, which is what
 * `test/forecast-sweep-parity.test.mjs` exists to do for the other twinned pair
 * in this office.
 *
 * PURE ON PURPOSE, for `stakeRefusalFor`'s reason one function up: the decision
 * takes the facts and returns the answer, so a falsifier can put an empty
 * balance in front of it with no store, no clone and no crossing.
 *
 * ── THE THREE CASES IT MUST NOT TOUCH ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * · `promoted: false` — an ordinary stake on an already-public mark, which
 *   `promoteDraftOnStake` calls "the ordinary answer … and never an error".
 *   This door retracts the promotion IT JUST MADE and nothing else; a pending
 *   row some other act filed is not this act's to take off the docket.
 * · `applied >= 1` — a PARTIAL stake (holds 1, asks 3) leaves something real
 *   behind the mark, and a partially backed claim is the candle's to judge at
 *   the close, not the door's to refuse at submit.
 * · `ownGround` anything but `false` — the 2026-08-28 ruling makes an own-ground
 *   mark publishable with nothing behind it, and `null` means the office could
 *   not tell. Refusing on "could not tell" would retract a lawful publication

 * later the stakes read said escrow 2 and the doorstep said 122, so mari
 * reported the receipt as false and, rightly, did not stake again. The receipt
 * was true: commit 31efde4 was on town main before the answer went out (the
 * exec's penCommit returns only once its commit is an ancestor of origin/main).
 * The read-backs were behind it, by design and by different amounts:
 *
 *   · world { read: "stake" } reads the ledger the exec just wrote. Current.
 *   · household { read: "stakes" } and the doorstep's stakes segment read the
 *     store's copy of the ledger (escrow_projection), which only the clearing
 *     takes, at 06:00/18:00Z. Up to twelve hours behind.
 *   · household { read: "stamps" } and the doorstep read the office's read
 *     index, rebuilt about every fifteen minutes.
 *
 * So the receipt says this itself, at the moment a resident is deciding
 * whether to trust it. It adds no reader and computes nothing it does not
 * already know: the commit, the settlement clock, a sentence. Making every
 * read-back current inside the act is POS-341 (Darko's 10-04 ruling: the
 * ledger's lines in the store, appended in the act's own transaction).
 *
 * `pushed` is TOWN_PUSH: only then has the commit been checked against
 * origin/main, so only then does the sentence say "on town main".

 * ONE ROW OF THE BACKED LIST — a stake of yours, and the mark it stands behind.
 *
 * Exported and PURE because it is the decision, not the plumbing: `yours` is a
 * sentence the town says to a resident about their own work, and it was wrong
 * for as long as it was computed off a record that had not been written yet.
 * A falsifier that could only reach it through a town clone and a stake state
 * would be asserting the fixture.
 *
 * ⚑ THE OWNER IS IN THE ID (2026-09-07). A mark id IS `<by>/<slug>` — "the 1.0
 * path identity", 006's own words — so the author is readable from the identity
 * alone, with no record to look up. The old line read `yours: Boolean(mark &&
 * belongs(mark.by))`, and `mark` came from PUBLISHED canon only, so a mark that
 * had not crossed yet produced `{ by: null, kind: null, tier: null, body: null,
 * holder: "wright", stamps: 1, yours: false }` — a resident's own staked mark,
 * every field empty, declared not theirs, in the same answer that named the
 * stake behind it (walk of 2026-09-06).

    description: "Put your stamps behind a mark in the told world — and if the mark is one of your own private drafts, THIS IS WHAT PUBLISHES IT. Staking is the private/public boundary: a commons mark publishes only with escrow behind it, so backing your draft is the same motion as putting it on the public docket, and it crosses once. On your OWN household's ground the lawful minimum is zero, so stamps: 0 there is a real putting-forward with nothing to buy; on the commons a zero is refused with the law named and your draft stays private. Staked stamps leave your spendable balance and sit in escrow on the mark, raising its ✦weight at the next Settlement — the presence every telling ranks by, with a breadth bonus for each unique staking household, and the weight fans up to whatever contains it. They are yours the whole time: world_unstake takes them back. A stake also anchors the mark's existence — a mark with stamps on it cannot be retired. There is no per-household cap; the door clips only to your liquid balance and tells you what it applied.",
