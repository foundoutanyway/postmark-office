// world-stance.mjs — THE CONSENT DOOR. A resident's word on what lands on their ground.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// POS-5's consent verb, sequenced after the ladder's slice 2 because stance rows
// enter through the single log as its FIRST NEW VERB. `declare-stance-on` has
// been a planted red for twelve days; every design call below is ruled, and this
// module implements them rather than re-deriving them.
//
// ── THE LAW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The class mark `the-town/declare-stance-on` (world record, under
// `postmark-edge`, tier constitution, v5), verbatim:
//
//   "A stance is a revisable word on an edge — welcomed or opposed, latest wins;
//    neutral is never stored, it is absence. The ground's holder speaks."
//
// Its page, `LOGOS/the-response-function.md`, gives the tri-state and the two
// clauses this door leans on hardest:
//
//   "neutral — the resting state: the child stands, uncoupled … Neutral is the
//    default everywhere, and it is what makes gifts, strangers, and latency
//    survivable"
//
//   "opposed — the veto: on sovereign ground it is absolute and
//    INTERSECTION-KEYED (a claim cannot dodge the law by being slightly too big
//    to be a child)"
//
// and the storage rule this module's write path is:
//
//   "The town's responses are never stored — law applied is recomputable, and
//    opinions belong to nobody. Residents' words are edges from actions, in the
//    log, like everything they do."
//
// `the-deferred-gate` (constitution, 2026-08-22): "The door writes every sketch
// wherever it points and judges nothing; placement, stance, and refusal are the
// crossing's work." So THIS DOOR RECORDS AND EXPOSES. It does not enforce. What a
// stance DOES to a fold is settlement work and is not in this lane.
//
// `the-late-welcome` (constitution, same planting): "A stance may arrive after
// the sketch and before the publish; the ledger keeps who was first." That
// sentence is why the candidate inbox can show a sketch that has not published:
// if a stance could only be spoken after canonization there would be nothing for
// the crossing to read, and the deferred gate would have deferred to nobody.
//
// ── WHO MAY SPEAK ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "The ground's holder speaks." A mark with extent IS ground, so the speakers for
// an incoming mark are the holders of every already-standing mark whose extent it
// overlaps — precedent weighs in on the newcomer, never the reverse. Overlap, not
// containment: that is `intersection-keyed`, and the engine's own `overlapArea`
// is what answers it, read at a ref rather than re-implemented here.
//
// ── NEUTRAL HAS NO ARGUMENT, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────────────
//
// There are two stances and there is no third. Returning to neutral has no
// grammar today and that is the law's own consequence, not an omission: a row
// meaning "no opinion" would BE a stored neutral, and neutral is absence. A
// resident revises by declaring the other word; latest wins.
//
// ⚑ AMENDED BY RULING (Darko, 2026-10-06, POS-361): ONE TAXONOMY, THREE WORDS.
// A resident may now DECLARE neutral: it clears "awaiting your word" and
// confers nothing. Silence stays the awaiting state. The town speaks the same
// words through this same verb (`as: "town"`, town-stance.mjs), its welcomed
// reserved for adoption. And every word records the version of the mark it was
// spoken on: a word on an older version is absent, so an amendment reopens it.
// The paragraph above is kept as the record of what the law said before.
//
// ── THE CANDIDATE SET IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED ───────────────────────────────
//
// No subscriptions, no inbox table, no fan-out. A candidate is computed at read
// time from geometry plus the store: the marks you hold, the marks that overlap
// them and postdate them, minus the ones you have already spoken about. That is
// O(k·m) over declarations where k is the handful of marks a household holds —
// the read-side cost the ladder's §0 certainty ruling explicitly permits ("the
// engine's `childrenByGeometry` at the read — O(k·m) client-side over
// declarations, no fold"), and emphatically not a fold.
//
// Env: WORLD_SINGLE_LOG=1. A stance door with no journal has no write path at
// all, so the write bounces by name when the flag is off; the reads degrade to
// canon-only rather than failing.

// ── THE TEACHING LINE (walk #1 item 4 · walk #2, 2026-09-05/06) ─────────────
//
// WHAT A RESIDENT ASKED, twice, in their own words:
//
//   "The law line says 'A stance is a revisable word on an edge — welcomed or
//    opposed, latest wins; neutral is never stored.' It does NOT say what my
//    'opposed' would DO to a mark the town has already published, nor why I was
//    not asked when it was laid. … 'welcomed or opposed' on a done thing feels
//    like a survey."
//
// The `law:` line below has always been right and has never been enough: it
// says what a stance IS, and the question is what one DOES. So the read now
// carries a second block that answers it out of the record.
//
// READ, NEVER TYPED. `the-town/the-media`'s doctrine, applied here: "Ids only.
// The sentences live in the record and arrive by read" (household-media.mjs
// § the three marks this door stands on). A sentence typed into this file is a
// copy nothing keeps honest — the exact class the 2026-08-31 civic-quarter lane
// found on a page. So the two sentences are SLICED OUT of the world checkout's
// own `LOGOS/the-response-function.md` at read time, by anchors that either
// match or say plainly that they did not.
//
// NO SECOND STAMP. The brief for this lane asked for the sha of the world pin
// beside the quote. It is deliberately absent: the office's world checkout
// already reports which version it read at the world reads (and Lane A is this
// week fixing exactly the case where a fresh stamp sat on a stale answer), and
// a second stamp minted here would be a second answer to "which world is this"
// — one stamp for one answer. The block names the FILE; the checkout names the
// version.
const RESPONSE_FUNCTION_FILE = join("LOGOS", "the-response-function.md");
// The two anchors, and both are load-bearing sentences of the law rather than
// convenient landmarks: the first is what `opposed` DOES, the second is what
// standing under an unanswered word costs you (nothing).

  { key: "opposed", from: "opposed — the veto:", to: "\n" },

  // THE HALF THAT MAKES THE GAP A PAIR RATHER THAN A SILENCE (fresh reviewer,
  // 2026-09-07). The response function does not merely fail to speak about a
  // word declared after publication — it says the resident's word is safe

  // "before the publish". Two sentences that disagree are an UNRULED PAIR, and

// ── UNWRAP BEFORE YOU SEARCH ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `the-response-function.md` is hand-wrapped prose, and both sentences this
// door quotes straddle a line break in the file today. An anchor matched
// against the raw bytes therefore depends on where the author's editor happened
// to break the line — the falsifier's fixture wrapped one of them one word
// earlier than the live file does and the anchor missed, which is the whole
// class in miniature: a quote whose retrieval depends on typography is a quote
// that silently stops being served the next time somebody reflows a paragraph.
//
// So the file is normalized FIRST and the anchors are matched against the
// normalized text: emphasis dropped (a reader hears none), wrapped lines
// rejoined, and a line that begins a new bullet or heading left as its own line
// so the three tri-state bullets stay three sentences and not one.

// ── THE NARROW 2.0 READ, BUILT (POS-195 / DEC-14, RULING 2, 2026-09-22) ──────
//
// This arm read the sqlite journal until 2026-09-22. It now reads the store,
// through `stance_reader` — a credential that exists for this one function.
//
// WHAT WAS IN THE WAY, and why the port needed a migration rather than a wire.
// DEC-14 (runbook, ruled 2026-09-03) gave this list "its own narrow 2.0 read
// that may see overlapping drafts across households" and judged it "blocks
// nothing today". G1 removes the journal INSERT that was this arm's source, and
// G1 comes before G2, so that note stopped being true. The 2026-09-22
// measurement then found the road right and the PERMISSION absent: a private
// draft's only row in the store is `claims` at status 'draft', 007's
// `claims_read` binds PUBLIC with no `TO` clause, RLS is ENABLE so only
// `world2_owner` escapes it, 002 bars that role from runtime, and there is no
// `SECURITY DEFINER` and no `BYPASSRLS` anywhere in `world2/`. Not unwired —
// unrepresentable. RULING 2 made the law; `world2/schema/023_stance_reader.sql`
// is it, and that file's header carries the argument.
//
// ── THE BODY IS NOT FETCHED, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN NOT RETURNED ────────────
//
// The ruling: "the derivation's OUTPUT carries what the 1.0 read carries today
// — a candidate's existence, standing and weight — never a draft's body."
//
// ⚠ MEASURED, AND IT IS A BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, NOT A PRESERVATION. The 1.0 read
// DID carry the body: `candidatesFrom` copied `body` onto every candidate, tier
// 2 published a 120-character excerpt as `says`, and tier 3's page carried the
// body WHOLE and untruncated. So a resident could read another household's
// unstaked sketch, in full, at `read: "declare-stance-on"`. The ruling's own
// apposition reads that as already-narrow and it was not. Reported to Wright as
// this lane's STOP; built the way the ruling's operative clause says, because
// "never a draft's body" is the half a falsifier can hold and the half the
// sentinel test asserts.
//
// `stanceQuery`'s column list does not include `claims.body`. The draft's text
// is not filtered out downstream — it is never read out of the store, so there
// is no path by which a future caller re-exposes it by forgetting a filter.
// A CANON mark keeps its body: it is published, every resident may read it, and
// the teaching block (`lateWelcome`) is one of those bodies.
//
// ── ABSENT CREDENTIAL IS `unreachable`, NEVER THE JOURNAL ───────────────────
//
// There is no fallback arm. `WORLD2_STANCE_URL` unset, or a store that will not
// answer, returns `{ unreachable }` and every tier says so — `stanceInbox` turns
// it into its own `unavailable`, which tiers 1, 2 and 3 already render. A read
// that answered `[]` instead would tell a resident nothing awaits their word
// while a sketch sat on their ground, which is the exact failure the-late-welcome

// ── THE READ MOVES TO THE REGISTER (G1 lane 3b, 2026-09-08) ─────────────────
//
// The comment above this function used to end "At cutover this read moves to
// the acts record (G2); until then the mirror + the photographs ARE the record
// on 1.0." This is that move, pulled forward, because G1 cannot ship without it.
//
// THE DEFECT IT CLOSES, and it is #2454 wearing a different coat. Both of the
// old union's halves die at the store cutover: the drain stops writing
// `STATE/log/<n>.journal.jsonl` (there is no drain), and the sqlite journal
// stops being the pen. So on the first store crossing this read would answer
// `[]` for a town with live stances, every `standing` stance would go back to
// `stances_awaiting`, and the door would show a world in which the declaration
// never happened — which is the exact sentence #2454 was written to make false.
//
// AND THE MERGE KEY HAD TO CHANGE, WHICH IS NOT A DETAIL. The old union merged
// by `seq`, which was sound while both halves carried the SAME numbering: a
// photograph line and a live journal row for one act share the journal's seq.
// The register does not. `acts.id` is its own sequence (in the 4,000s where the
// journal is in the 1,000s) and `acts.journal_seq` is null for 4,483 of 4,689
// rows, so a seq-keyed union would have carried EVERY act twice — once under
// its journal seq and once under its act id — and `standingStances` would then
// have picked whichever copy happened to be last. The key is the twin key
// `(actor, action, object, written_at)`, which is `falsifier-pen-flip`'s own
// (`twinKey`) and the only thing that names one act across two numberings.
//
// A stance is safe under that key where a MARK would not be: Phase 5.6's
// deferral moves an unstaked declaration's instant, and only marks are deferred
// (`world-journal.mjs § privateDraftAct` is `CLASS_MARK` + leave-mark/amend).
// Measured 2026-09-08: 29 stance lines in the photograph, 28 in the register,
// and the one extra is a genuine duplicate — seq 1084 and 1123 are lupi's same
// declaration at the same instant, written twice. The twin key collapses it,
// which is the register being right.
//
// THE REGISTER IS PREFERRED, NOT EXCLUSIVE. It is the copy that survives the
// cutover, so where both hold an act the register's row is the one kept. But a
// register that cannot be reached must not empty the town: `actsQuery` answers
// `null` for "not asked" and an array for "asked", and only the array is

// where that grant is in your spine or reach — and measured against the live
// store, `world { read: "declare-stance-on", handle: "wright" }` bounces 422,
// "not an action anywhere in your view — nothing to read", while
// `stanceInbox` for that same resident holds NINETEEN candidates awaiting their
// word. Nothing tells them. A consent law nobody is told they are party to is
// a law with no door, which is the shape the town has ruled against before.
//
// SO THE INBOX GETS A STANDING-SCOPED DOOR, and this is the round-2 precedent
// applied, not a new idea: mail folded under `household` because a letter needs
// STANDING, never a standpoint. What awaits your word is the same shape — it is
// derived from what you HOLD (`stanceInbox` keys on `key.handles` and nothing
// else), never from where your feet are. The world's read is unchanged and
// stays what it is: what you find when standing on your own ground.

// it, exactly as the town apex names a flat verb rather than copying it.
//
// AND IT NEVER THROWS. The doorstep is the recommended first read of the day;
// a morning page that 500s because the world engine is mid-write would be a
