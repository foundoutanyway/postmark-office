// world-units.mjs — THE UNIT DOOR: give, take, drop, consume and refill of
// counted units (WLD-27). The adjudication is world-stacks.mjs's, pure; this
// file reads the record, asks the reach, serializes on the hold lane's queue
// and writes the act. Reached through `world_hold` (world-hold.mjs §
// callHoldTool), because "give, take, drop" are the hold verbs whatever they
// hold (the brief: "reuse give/take/drop"), and `consume`/`refill` ride the
// same tool as `act:`.
//
// WHICH ACT A CALL IS — read off its arguments, never guessed:
//
//   act: "consume"                     one held unit used up (from your hands)
//   act: "consume", thing: <unit mark> a dropped unit consumed where it stands
//   act: "refill", chest: <chest id>   the label's creator tops a chest up
//   from: <chest>, label?, count?      take units out of a chest
//   to: <resident|chest>, label?, count?   give units
//   label (no to, no from)             set ONE unit down: it becomes a mark
//   thing: <a dropped unit's mark>     take it back into your hands
//   thing:, to: <chest>                put a whole thing into a chest
//   thing:, from: <chest>              take a whole thing out of one (a thing a
//                                      chest holds is also taken out by naming it)
//
// ⚑ THE MARK'S EXIT RETURNS STAKES THROUGH THE TOWN'S OWN UNSTAKE. When a
// dropped unit stops being a mark (taken back, or consumed in place), each
// actual staker's open position on that mark comes home as that staker's own
// unstake line — the engine's line, one per staker — so the ledger itself is
// the memory that makes it once: a retry reads positions already closed and
// plans nothing (world-stacks.mjs § returnsAtExit). This file never writes a
// ledger line of its own and never runs in a lane against a real ledger: the
// tests drive it with a synthetic one.

// pen, outside the hold queue; if the filing fails the unit comes back. While

// check reads it as carried — so another hold cannot take the freed slot and

// § inFlightFor) and the withdrawal — deed, docket half, and the unit's return
// in its one transaction (drop-recovery.mjs § withdrawRestoreGuard) — is
// written before the turn ends, so no other add can take the slot between the
