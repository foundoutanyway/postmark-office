// answer with a seeded house's id, kept because it looked like "the more
// specific answer".
//
// It was also a wrong one, and could not be corrected by living here. A painting
// is not amendable, so for four months it outranked the record:

// on spar's coast and calls it MARKET, and fourteen of the painted house ids had
// already stopped being marks at all.
//
// SO THE OVERRIDE IS SIMPLY GONE, AND NOTHING REPLACES IT. `tools/where-is.mjs §
// homeOf` answers the question this field asks — it returns the household's
// parcel with `source: "parcel"`, the law the town already carries ("the parcel
// IS the home", ruling 7). The office now says what the engine says, for

// point it was disclosing. Measured for a groundless handle against the live
// fold: `standpoint.from` names the Origin, and `you.within` comes back
// `the-town/the-town-centre`, `the-town/the-quay-reach`,
// `the-town/the-town-centre-crossing`, `you.region` the-town-centre,
// `you.standingOn` the-main-channel at 125 m — the TOWN CENTRE's containment
// spine, none of it the reader's. kogane read nineteen residents "within 500 m"
// off the same point and wrote to the town about his neighbours. His own line:
// "A resident with no ground has no neighbours; eighteen shown is worse than
// none."
//
// The disclosure rides the STANDPOINT rather than each derived field, because
// the standpoint is the one thing every one of those fields is computed from and
// the one object both doors that compute them already carry: `worldOrient` and
// `worldEyes` each spread this return into `standpoint`, and the apex spreads
// `...oriented.standpoint` in turn. One place to say it, three doors that say it.
//
// ADDITIVE, on the `unreadable` precedent one screen down (§ worldBlockForHandle):
// the two keys are ABSENT on every placed path, `from` is byte-identical, and a
// reader that never learns about them reads exactly what it read before.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not move the standpoint — and as of #2900 it no
// longer has to. The collision this note used to report (the Origin here, the
// quay 5,833 m away at `residentStandpoint`, read by walk, presence and say) was
// ruled by the founder on 2026-09-17: "Agreed with the Origin." The Origin is
// now the ONE answer, owned in `./groundless.mjs` and asked by all three
// derivations, so the sentence below and the standpoint every other door hands
// out are the same claim about the same point.
//
// Re-exported, not re-declared: the string lives in `./groundless.mjs` so
// `positions.mjs` can carry it onto a presence row without importing this file

// takes no more lines. `dynamic.db/movements` is era two. A reader that knows
// only the first one is reading a town that stopped moving on the day of the
// freeze — which is exactly what shipped, and what this function exists to end.
//
// THE DISEASE THIS IS THE CURE FOR. Four live sites each assembled departures
// from `parseWalkLedger` alone: the standpoint, hearing, the walk's own `from`,
// and the walkers door. One question — where has this resident been — with four
// derivations that agreed only while there was a single era to read. The day the
// freeze landed, twenty-seven residents had an ashore record in the store that
// no reader consulted, so `world_walkers` served them at the berth they had left
// and `/world/present` could not find them at all. That is issue #7's disease
// again, one layer down and across a seam this time; the cure is the same one —
// ONE function, and every site calls it.
//
// CONCAT, NOT SORT — and the first draft of this got it wrong.
//
// Sorting the merged list by instant looks like the safer choice and is not.
// THE LEDGER'S FILE ORDER IS ITS LAW: it is append-only and "latest wins" means
// latest APPENDED, which the engine implements by taking the last match in array
// order. Those two orders disagree in the real ledger — the 2026-08-08 sailing
// filed every passenger at `18:00:00.000Z` and those lines were appended after
// walks stamped 18:16 — so re-sorting era one by instant silently changes WHICH
// RECORD GOVERNS for any resident with out-of-order lines. That is a semantic
// change to the founding era, made by a reader, which is the one thing the seam
// promised not to do. (Caught by the flag-off door test: 317 records in, first
// divergence at index 105, rook-of-garrison governed by a different leg.)
//
// So era one keeps its own order, untouched, and era two is appended after it —
// correct because every store record postdates the freeze. That assumption is
// CHECKED rather than trusted: a store record older than the newest ledger line
// means the freeze assumption has broken, and it is disclosed instead of being
// quietly mis-ordered.
//
// FEATURE-DETECTED, DISCLOSED, ERA-1 ON ANY FAILURE. With the flag off the record
// is not read at all and this returns exactly what `parseWalkLedger` returned.
//
// `db` IS GONE (POS-154): era two came from a sqlite handle a caller could pass
// in, and it comes from the record now, which has no handle to hand over.
//
// `fromSnapshot` (POS-302) is for the positions projection alone: BOTH eras
// then come from the newest clearing's snapshot plus the acts since
// (`world-movement.mjs § storedGoverningDepartures`), era one as the store's
// `_ledger` rows and no git read at all. It is a list `governingOf` reduces

//                choice for its own reasons — `source: standAs ?? handle` — and
//                the two are answering different questions.) Whose body lent
//                the standpoint rides the payload where it belongs.
//   written_at   voice.at — WHEN IT WAS SAID, not when this hook ran.
//   at           stamped at the voice's OWN x/y (witnessStampAt), never at the
//                speaker's position now.
//   witnesses    who was within earshot, pinned — the-witnessed-line's plural,
//                and for speech the most literal witnesses this log will ever
//                hold.
//   household    `resolvedWorldHousehold(key)` — THE SAME RESOLVER THE MARK
//                LANE USES, threaded down through `voices.say` rather than
//                re-derived here. One column, one spelling: world2-claims.mjs
//                already paid for the alternative once ("one column carried

 *
 * WHY IT HAD TO BE CARRIED. `at` above is `witnessStampAt`'s PLACE anchor
 * (`{anchor, dx, dy}`), not an instant, and nothing else here was one — so
 * `world-journal.mjs § normalizeRow` fell back to its own clock for
 * `written_at`, and that column IS `acts.at`, which is the instant every world
 * reader of a departure reads first (`live-reads § departureRecordOf`, era 5:
 * `iso: isoOf(row.at)`). POS-196 measured the cost on the record itself: of
 * 2,808 live door-written lines in windows 120–204, the act's own `crossing`
 * reconstructs the instant exactly ZERO times, median −203 ms, 235 of them
 * missing by more than a second, the worst by 10.6 hours. The register could
 * not render the record while its instant was the mirror's clock.
 *
 * `declared_by` and `note` ride the payload for the same reason and in the
 * record's own spelling. `note` is CONDITIONAL, as it is on the record's own
 * 2,870 lines (28 carry it), so a walk with no note writes no key rather than a
 * null one — the register agreeing with the grammar it is rendered into.

//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The radial NAMES ids: `objects` here, `within`/`nearby`
// on the apex. Every reader of those ids then has to resolve each one against
// something else — and the one thing every reader had was the whole fold. So a
// door that answers "what can you see from here" in a few dozen entries was
// only usable by a caller holding 1,197 marks, which is the fold's cost paid to
// read a radial that deliberately is not the fold.
//
// So the read carries what it names. Not more: the promise is exactly "every id
// this response names, plus the town's ground", and its falsifiers are that
// biconditional in both directions — an id with no record is a broken read, and
// a record for an id the response never named is the fold creeping back in.
//
// THE GROUND SET is the one whole that is not derived from the standpoint, and
// it is here because the painting's FLOOR is not a thing you can see — it is
// the sheet the seen things stand on. It is small and it is fixed: the thirteen
// region rings the record's own roster names, plus the water the skeleton's own
// selection names. It is NOT a second fold: it does not grow with the town's
// marks, only with the town's REGIONS, which is a founding act.
//
// ⚑ THE SELECTION IS RESTATED HERE, and that is a cost, not a tidiness. The
// viewer owns the same rule in `townRegionMarks`/`townWaterShapes`
// (spectator/viewer.mjs), and those live in a DOM module the office cannot
// import. What is reused rather than restated is every part that can be: the
// roster (`REGION_SLUGS`), the ring reader (`polygonOf`) and the water
// selection (`waterFeatures`/`seaFeature`) all come from the engine the office
// already imports. What is restated is the ten-line join and the sentinel cut.

// comfortably under the yardstick, and large enough to inline the great
// majority of the town's images.

 * THE GROUND'S LAWFUL MINIMUM STAKE — the number that decides whether a stake

 *
 * The town's economy law is the whole rule, and 1.0 already stated it:
 * "commons marks (any ground not your household's own) publish ONLY while
 * backed by escrow". So:
 *
 *   YOUR OWN SOVEREIGN GROUND -> minimum 0. Nothing needs buying; an explicit
 *     `stamps: 0` is a deliberate putting-forward and publishes.
 *   COMMONS (anyone else's ground, or none) -> minimum 1. A zero stake is
 *     refused with the law named, and the mark stays a private draft.
 *
 * A DE-SITED MARK inherits its parent's answer rather than being treated as
 * commons: "a predicated mark is its parent continued" (004), and a mark with
 * no ground of its own is not standing on the commons — it is standing on
 * whatever its parent stands on.
 *
 * TODO(standing): this is the MINIMAL own-ground check the ruling authorised,
 * and it asks the question the standing lane answers properly — "whose ground
 * is this". `world2/tools/standing.mjs` LANDED 2026-08-24 (doors read standing
 * via src/standing.mjs; recompute at the candle's close since 08-28), but this
 * reader has not been cut over to it: the containment walk there handles
 * nesting, retired ground, and the overlay cases that this flat parcel scan
 * does not. This comment retires when this function reads standing.mjs. Until then the
 * conservative direction is deliberate — an unrecognised ground reads as
 * commons, so the failure mode is "your mark stayed private", never "your
 * mark published for free on someone else's land".

  //
  // THE OWN HAND is the one thing the human class exists to protect: it
  // `implements: ["the-town/the-own-hand"]`, and human-actor.mjs says what that
  // costs — "A record that wrote the resident's name on a human's words would be
  // the one thing this class exists to prevent." A walk is a record of a BODY
  // MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD: `declareMovement` writes `actor` into
  // dynamic.db/movements, position is derived from that row, and every reader
  // downstream — the standpoint, presence, the crossing-save's STATE/log/ line —
  // treats that actor as a thing standing somewhere.
  //
  // So this door has exactly two ways to write an embodied human's walk and both
  // are false:
  //
  //   · UNDER THE RESIDENT'S HAND — which is the violation itself, and the
  //     silent one: the resident's body moves, on the record, on the human's
  //     word, and nothing anywhere says a human was involved.
  //   · UNDER THE HUMAN'S HAND — which writes a walker the world cannot place.
  //     The human has no home mark, no standpoint and no presence row; `from`
  //     would fall back to `homeCoords` and stand them at the Origin, and the save
  //     would crystallize an entity the atlas has no seat for.
  //
  // The second is the humans-as-residents design, and LOGOS/classes.md § The
  // human class is explicit that it has not arrived: "everything further waits
  // for the humans-as-residents design, and arrives — if it arrives — as law

  // A refusal is the correct terminal state here, not a placeholder: the same
  // shape `walkAllowed` uses one door up ("The refusal NAMES its reason; it is

  // door the office has not built a room behind.

  // The refusal below named two ways to write an embodied walk and called both
  // false. It was right about both, and it missed a third that the founder has
  // now ruled: WRITE THE SEAT'S WALK AND SAY WHOSE ACT IT WAS.
  //
  // LOGOS § The three channels: "Any act needing a record WRITES THROUGH THE
  // SEAT — the resident whose household hosts the human — and the answer says
  // so. The human has no home mark, no standpoint and no threshold record; the
  // seat has all three, and they are the ones actually moving. … writing the
  // seat's name in SILENCE is the ghost-writing the human class exists to
  // prevent. The disclosure is what makes the difference."
  //
  // So the first horn — "under the resident's hand … and nothing anywhere says
  // a human was involved" — is answered exactly where it was sharpest: the
  // silence. The row is the seat's because the seat is the body that moves, and
  // `acted_by` on the answer is the part that was missing.
  //
  // ⚑ FENCED TO A SEATING GROUND, and this office does not decide which. The
  // apex resolves seating from the admitted calculus (scope and all) and names
  // it in `__seated_ground`; without that word this door still refuses, so the
  // flat tool and the REST body reach the 501 exactly as before. The escalation
  // question is answered one line down regardless: `who` must be a resident THIS
  // KEY HOLDS, so the worst a forged word can buy is a walk the caller could
  // already have taken under their own hand.
