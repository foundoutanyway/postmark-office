// 001_tables.sql says what this column holds: "denormalized at submit from
// identities". This pen was writing the journal's own `household` field, which is
// a bare resident handle (`darko`) — so one column carried three spellings of one
// fact: `gh:<id>` from the seed, NULL where the seed found no roster line, and a
// bare handle from here.
//
// Wright's ruling, 2026-08-28: adopt 1.0's spelling. A roster owner keeps the
// household KEY; a non-roster owner is `solo:<handle>`, never NULL. That is the
// fold's `declared_household` rule verbatim — `households[handle] ?? solo:<handle>`
// (marks-fold.mjs § the household grain) — and `identities` is the projection of
// the very file the fold reads, so asking it here gives the register and the
// docket one answer.
//
// ONLY POSITIVE ANSWERS ARE CACHED, deliberately. A handle that has a household
// key does not lose it, so caching that is safe. A MISS is the registry-lag case
// the fold's own comment describes — "registry lag never blocks a new resident, it
// only leaves them ungrouped until the town knows them" — and it resolves the
// moment law_ingester projects the new roster line. Caching the miss would keep
// writing `solo:` for a resident the town had already learned, for as long as the
// office stayed up.

/**
 * THE ONE RESOLVER, called by BOTH halves of the private-draft lane.
 *
 * The write path resolves the household from the journal row's `household`
 * (the acting handle's house); `/world2/my-drafts` resolves it
 * from the same key. If those two ever spelled the household differently, a
 * resident would save a draft and then be told they have none — the row policy
 * would be working perfectly and the answer would still be wrong. Routing both
 * through this function is what makes that unrepresentable, so do not inline
 * either half.
 *
 * ── "THE TWO NETS ARE ONE NET" — ASKED AND ANSWERED (2026-09-07) ───────────
 *
 * Lane A observed that the WHERE clause in `pgLiveMarks` and 007's row policy
 * both key off this function's output, so a wrong row in `identities` defeats
 * both at once and there is no independent check. That observation is true and
 * it is ACCEPTED DESIGN, not a defect to file — written down here rather than
 * opened as an issue, on the reviewer's reading, which is the better one:
 *
 *   the IDENTITY is one fact, and the two mechanisms enforce two different
 *   things over it. The WHERE clause bounds the result set; the row policy
 *   bounds what the credential may return AT ALL — and only the second survives
 *   a new reading surface written by somebody who did not know it was needed.
 *   That is exactly 007's own argument for the policy ("enforced structurally,
 *   not by vigilance"), and it is why the two are not redundant.
 *
 * A wrong row in `identities` does defeat both. It also defeats every other
 * notion of who you are in this town, which is what makes this function's
 * single-resolver discipline the right shape rather than a shared weakness:
 * one fact, one place to be wrong, one place to fix.
 *
 * ── THROUGH THE KEY'S HANDLES, AS 1.0 DOES (POS-142, agreed 2026-10-01) ────
 *
 * This read `key.household` first, and that is a LABEL: the GitHub login an
 * OAuth key resolved to, or a keys-file slug ("darko"). Neither is a handle
 * the registry pins, so an OAuth resident whose login is not one of their
 * residents' handles resolved to `solo:<login>` and read an empty portfolio
 * and none of their own drafts, while the write path, which resolves from the
 * acting HANDLE (`world-apex.mjs § worldHouseholdOf`), had filed those drafts
 * under their house. 1.0 already answers this (`world-stake.mjs §
 * worldPortfolioStakeSlice`): "the household a caller belongs to is the
 * pins-household of their own handles". So: the first of the key's handles
 * the registry places in a house names it. Only when none does is the label
 * asked, and `keyHouseholdOf` says so on `disclosure`.

/**
 * ── THE DERIVER ANSWERS IT NOW (POS-160, the w40 ship) ──────────────────────
 *
 * This used to read `identities.household` — a projection of the WORLD repo's
 * copy of the town's pins, four hops from the fact, answering in whichever
 * spelling that copy happened to carry. So the store's rows recorded the same
 * house two ways depending on when the row was written: measured on the live
 * registry 2026-09-22, 173 of 190 handles wore `gh:<id>` and 17 wore
 * `hh:<slug>`, and two handles of ONE house could wear one of each.
 *
 * It now asks `household-deriver.mjs`, the office's one walk over the registry
 * that IS the record (`households` + `household_pins`, 019/020/021), and
 * answers `hh:<slug>` — the key the ship writes from its law date on.
 *
 * ── WHICH ROWS MOVE, AND WHICH DO NOT ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every NEW row this pen writes from the law date carries `hh:<slug>`. Rows
 * already in the store keep the spelling they were written with, and that is a
 * problem THIS FUNCTION CANNOT SOLVE, because 007's draft row policy was a
 * string equality (`household = current_setting('app.household', true)`): a
 * resident whose key re-spells stops seeing their own drafts.
 *
 * ── AND THE ROWS DO NOT MOVE. THE READ WIDENS. (RULING 4, PROVISIONAL) ──────
 *
 * `022_household_respell.sql` was going to re-spell them and is now RETIRED to
 * a header and `SELECT 1;`. The store refuses the rewrite by three separate
 * laws, each measured on the dev sandbox 2026-09-22: `acts_append_only`,
 * `claims_update_guard` (`NEW.household IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.household` on
 * every lawful transition) and `marks_id_is_fixed`. A row's household spelling
 * is fixed for its life, which is what this module's own header has always said
 * about history.
 *
 * So a house declares EVERY SPELLING IT HAS EVER CARRIED and the policy
 * compares against the set: `household-deriver.mjs § houseKeysOf` builds it,
 * `§ sessionKeysFor` is what a session declares, `withHousehold` above puts it
 * on the connection as `app.household_keys`, and
 * `024_household_spellings.sql`'s four policies read it. There is no backfill
 * and no window to run one in — the INSTALL block is a policy migration that
 * changes no row.
 *
 * ── THE MEMO STILL ONLY REMEMBERS A YES ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `solo:` answer is NOT cached, exactly as before. It means "the registry has
 * never heard of this handle", which is a fact that changes the moment a join
 * lands — and a cached absence would keep a brand-new resident outside their
 * own house for the life of the process. A named house does not change under a
 * running request, so that one is remembered.

 * THE HOUSE AN ACT IS FILED UNDER — the one answer for `acts.household` and

 *   2. a human's hand (`human-of-<x>`, `households.mjs § humanHandHouse`): the
 *      house it was named after;
 *   3. the row's `household`, which is whatever the door put there.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE FIX. A door puts the KEY'S LABEL on `row.household` (the
 * GitHub login an OAuth key resolved to: the draft branch's name since 1.0,
 * and `pinnedLoginOf`'s answer for a placer), and a login is not a spelling
 * the deriver may read for an account pinned by id (`accountMatches`: a
 * recycled login must not reach the house). So asking it first filed every act
 * of a signed-in resident under `solo:<login>`: measured on the 10-08 dump,
 * 2,938 acts and 260 claims since the law date, against 859 and 16 under the
 * slug. Asked of the handle, the same rows name their house.
 *
 * THE ROADS ARE NARROW ON PURPOSE (review of #438). A handle reaches its house
 * as a resident or through its pin's id, never as a slug: `mari` is a resident
 * of starforge AND the slug of another house. A human's hand `human-of-<x>` was
 * minted from a slug when the house had one, so `hh:<x>` is asked first (the
 * slug roads), then `<x>` as a handle.
 *
 * A HOUSELESS ACTOR IS ITS OWN `solo:<handle>`. The row's `household` (the
 * key's login label) is never handed to the deriver as a bare string: it would
 * be read as a handle, a slug or a former slug, and a stranger whose login is
 * some house's name would file into that house. Only a row with no actor falls
 * back to its `household`, as before; one already carrying `solo:` is not
 * wrapped twice (the census found `solo:solo:martes` on a ride act).

// `acts` — while putting a compose and its withdrawal in one order.

/**
 * A PENDING CLAIM, TAKEN BACK OFF THE DOCKET. One retraction, two callers.
 *
 * `pending -> retracted` is one of the four transitions `claims_update_guard`
 * permits an office pen (007_private_drafts.sql § the transition guard), and
 * gold §1's reason is in the guard's own comment: "retraction is free until
 * close". A retracted row STAYS — 007's delete guard forbids removing a row the
 * public docket has carried — so the crossing's own account keeps it, under
 * `sixCount.retracted_before_close` (clearing-job.mjs § 6).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT TWO STATEMENTS ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Its callers ask for the same thing from opposite ends. `claimTxFromJournal`
 * retracts because a resident withdrew a claim that had stood publicly; the
 * stake door (world-stake.mjs § A STAKE THAT HOLDS NOTHING IS NEVER FILED)
 * retracts a promotion it made moments earlier and is about to refuse. Two
 * statements would be two notions of what retraction writes, and the second one
 * written would be the one that forgot `decided_at` — which is the column the
 * candle's own tally reads nothing of but every receipt beside it does.
 *
 * KEYED ON (window, slug, claimant) rather than on the claim's id, because that
 * is the key the withdraw arm has in hand: it is holding a journal row, not a
 * row id. The stake door has both and passes these three.
 *
 * `q` is a CLIENT when the caller holds a transaction (the withdraw arm rides
 * the pen's own), and null when it does not (the stake door, which has already
 * committed its promotion). The row policy takes no household declaration for
 * this write — `claims_update_office` is `USING (status <> 'draft' OR …)` and a
 * pending row satisfies the first arm — so the pool is a lawful place to run it.

 *
 * The ruling's plainest case -- you composed something, slept on it, and now
 * you back it. Staking is submitting, so this is the whole of what the stake
 * door has to do about the docket.
 *
 * ONE STATEMENT DOES THE PROMOTION AND THE STRIP, and that shape was taught by
 * the transition guard rather than chosen: a second `UPDATE ... SET data = data
 * - '_deferred_act'` on the now-PENDING row is not one of the four transitions
 * 007 permits, so it raised — after the promotion had already committed and the
 * act had already been mirrored. The guard was right and the code was wrong.
 * Reading the held act BEFORE the update and stripping it IN the update leaves
 * nothing for a second write to do.
 *
 * THE MIRROR RUNS INSIDE THE TRANSACTION NOW (R1, ruled and rebuilt
 * 2026-08-29). The old shape — `mirrorAct` after the COMMIT, on its own pool
 * and queue — was correct for two independent pens and became the design's
 * named atomicity hole F3: a promotion that commits and then fails to mirror
 * leaves a PENDING CLAIM WITH NO DEED on the public docket. The old deadlock
 * argument dissolved with the plumbing: `insertAct` takes THIS transaction's
 * own client, so there is no second pool to wait on. The act and the
 * promotion now commit together or not at all.
 *
 * THE ACT IS DATED AT THE PUTTING-FORWARD, not at the composing. The world
 * witnessed a resident put this mark forward; it did not witness them thinking
 * about it. Back-dating would also aim the row at a window the notary may have
 * frozen already — an append-only archive refusing a late arrival, which is the
 * repo catching the office rewriting history, correctly, over something that
 * would have been our own doing.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ROW DOES NOT SAY WHAT IT HOLDS (ruled 2026-09-12) ─────────────
 *
 * `stake` is the number ASKED. It has to be: this statement runs BEFORE the
 * stamp ledger, by the order the stake door's own comment argues for. So a
 * claim whose escrow move applied less than it asked carries a `stake` figure
 * that reads exactly like a backed claim — which is #2686, nine hours of
 * `stake: 1` behind a mark holding zero.
 *
 * The obvious repair was a second number on this row. It is NOT taken, and the
 * reason is worth the paragraph. Writing what the ledger moved would need a
 * write AFTER the ledger, onto a row that has already gone pending, and
 * `claims_update_guard` permits an office pen four transitions of which
 * `pending -> pending` is not one. The guard stays as it is (Keemin, 09-12): no
 * fifth transition, no migration.
 *
 * So the docket DERIVES it instead. `escrow_projection` (014) already holds the
 * open position per (mark, holder) as-of a town sha, and the candle's own gate
 * already reads it — `escrowPresenceAt` in world2/tools/escrow-presence.mjs.
 * world2-serve.mjs § THE DOCKET ROW asks that same reader, so the docket and
 * the gate it forecasts cannot disagree, no claim is ever rewritten, and a later
 * unstake shows up on the next read rather than leaving a stale snapshot behind.
 *
 * Returns { promoted, claim, window }. `promoted: false` is the ordinary answer
 * for a stake on an already-public mark, and never an error. `window` is the
 * candle the claim joined, which is the key its retraction is written against.

 *
 * This returned `state.queue` alone. That was right while `submitClaimFromJournal`

 * private-draft arm joined the pen's one queue (C6) and that function was
 * deleted. Nothing enqueues onto `state.queue` any more, so it resolves
 * instantly — and a caller that asked whether the docket was settled was told
 * yes before a single row had been written.
 *
 * `falsifier-guard-equality.mjs` is that caller, and it had written the reason
 * it waits directly above the wait: *"reading `claims` before it settles would
 * compare 1.0's finished journal against a docket still being written, and the
 * diff would be timing."* It then did exactly that — G1_a/G2_a/G4_a
 * `compared 0`, findings 4/4/5, every one of the form *"1.0's live layer holds
 * guards-alfa/the-quiet-shed and the port does not — a slug-collision guard
 * reading the port would PERMIT a duplicate."* Nothing was wrong with the port.
 *
 * FIXED HERE RATHER THAN AT THE CALL SITE, because the call site was not wrong:
 * it asked the honest question and got a false receipt. `settleShadowPens`
 * survived only by awaiting all three queues by hand, and nothing marked the
 * difference between the caller that happened to be safe and the one that was
 * not. A function named for the docket that knows only about a queue the docket
 * abandoned is the states-with-no-receipt class, wearing a receipt's coat.
 *
 * `state.queue` is still awaited beside the pen's. It is empty today, and
 * keeping it costs one already-resolved promise — where dropping it would mean
 * this answer silently stops covering anything that enqueues here again.

 * EVERY CLAIM THE STORE HOLDS FOR ONE SLUG, newest first — the receipt's half.
 *
 * The whole life of one mark on the docket: the draft it was composed as, the

 * reads the newest and reports the rest as history.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT SCOPED TO ONE HOUSEHOLD, AND WHY THAT IS LAWFUL ────────
 *
 * The docket is PUBLIC — 007_private_drafts.sql's row policy says so in one
 * line, and says which row is the exception:
 *
 *   CREATE POLICY claims_read ON claims FOR SELECT
 *     USING (status <> 'draft' OR household = current_setting('app.household', true));
 *
 * So a receipt on somebody else's pending claim is a public fact this door is
 * allowed to answer, and a receipt on their DRAFT is unrepresentable — not by a
 * WHERE clause here, but structurally, because `current_setting(…, true)`
 * answers NULL when nothing declared and NULL is never equal to anything.
 *
 * `household` is therefore the CALLER's, and it buys exactly one thing: the
 * caller's own drafts. Handed null, the read runs with nothing declared and the
 * policy hides every draft in town, the caller's included — which is the right
 * answer for a spectator and the reason this takes the argument rather than
 * resolving a key it was not given.
 *
 * ⚑ THE SET-LOCAL TRAP is `withHousehold`'s, and it is documented there: this
 * runs on a POOL, so `app.household` must never outlive its transaction. Do not
 * inline the declaration here.
