// world2-fold.mjs — THE WORLD PAGE'S FOLD, BUILT FROM THE STORE'S ROWS (POS-142).
//
// The fold is a derivation. The settlement runs the world's own
// `tools/marks-fold.mjs`: `loadMarks(dir)` reads `WORLD/marks/**/mark.md` into
// mark records, and `fold({ marks, terrain, stakes, … })` derives everything the
// World page reads from them. `/world/state` serves the file that fold wrote.
//
// This module is the other half of that sentence. `marksFromRows` turns the
// store's rows into the records `loadMarks` yields, so the SAME `fold()` — the
// world's module, imported at the blessed ref exactly as the rest of the office
// imports its engine — runs over them unchanged. There is no second fold here,
// and nothing below re-derives a fact the fold derives.
//
// ── WHERE EACH FIELD OF A `loadMarks` RECORD COMES FROM ──────────────────────
//
// `world2/tools/seed-import.mjs § recordData` is the reverse of this function:
// it kept every field of the loader's record in `data` except the ones a column
// holds (`HELD_BY_A_COLUMN`) and `_dir`. So:
//
//   id            marks.slug                (`<by>/<leaf>`, the loader's id)
//   slug          the leaf of marks.slug    (the mark's directory name)
//   kind          marks.kind
//   by            marks.owner
//   household     marks.owner               (the LOADER sets household = by; the
//                                            column holds the fold's household
//                                            KEY, which the fold re-derives)
//   body          marks.body
//   at / extent   marks.geometry            (world coordinates — the loader has
//   points        marks.geometry.points      already composed the frame; see
//                                            seed-import § the frame note)
//   parent        marks.parent → that row's slug, or `data._parent_is_law`
//                 (a parent that is a class mark lives in law_projection)
//   _parentMarkId data._parentMarkId, or the continuation parent for a
//                 predicated/naming row the live pen wrote (it carries none)
//   everything else  data                   (the record's own remainder)
//
// Class marks are LAW and are not in `marks` at all: `law_projection` holds
// them, `data` being the loader's record minus `_dir` (law-ingest § recordData).
//
// ── WHAT THE STORE CANNOT SAY, NAMED RATHER THAN GUESSED ─────────────────────
//
//   · ORDER. The loader walks the directory tree, and the fold's `marks` array
//     keeps that order. A mark's directory is its historical filing
//     (`WORLD/filing-freeze.json`) and no row records it, so the rows fold's
//     `marks` come out in slug order. `foldEquality` compares marks by id and
//     names the order as the one difference it forgives.
//   · `tier`. The seed stored the fold's DERIVED tier in `data.tier`, not the
//     line the file carries. The fold reads a record's tier for one question
//     only — is this the town's constitution (tools/mark-standing.mjs) — and the
//     derived value answers it the same way. The falsifier is what says so.
//
// A fact the fold needs that no row carries is a STOP for the reader to see,
// never a value filled in here.
