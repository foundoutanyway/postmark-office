// world2-guards.mjs — B1: `world2/tools/guard-reads.mjs`, WIRED INTO THE DOORS.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (runbook § 4 B1, quoted):
//
//   "`world2/tools/guard-reads.mjs` is merged, tested (falsifier-guard-equality.mjs,
//    G1–G6 green, seven injected faults each firing) — AND IMPORTED BY NOTHING.
//    `grep -rn "guard-reads" src/` returns zero hits. It is the split-brain gate,
//    finished and unwired."
//
// This module is the wire. It is the ONLY thing in `src/` that imports the port,
// so the port keeps its own law — "pure over rows and a pg client, nothing from
// `src/` is imported" — and the office keeps one place where the flag is read,
// one place where the household spelling is resolved, and one place where an
// unreachable guard turns into a refusal.
//
// ── THE FLAG IS READ, NOT MERELY SET (the flip's own discipline) ─────────────
//
// The runbook's §1 sentence about the C-series governs this lane too: "A flag is
// necessary and not sufficient … Every C-step is *wire the call site, then set
// the flag* — two things, and the receipt must prove both." So `W2_GUARDS=1` is
// read at each guard, through `guardsFlipped()`, and the receipt for this lane
// is the same shape as `penFor`'s: a probe that shows the door taking the other
// branch under the flag. A flag nothing reads is a state with no receipt.
//
// It rides `world2Enabled` the way `laneFlipped` does, and for the same reason:
// reading guards out of Postgres with no `WORLD2_PG_URL` is not a configuration,
// it is a crash waiting for the first duplicate slug.
//
// ── AN UNREACHABLE GUARD REFUSES. IT NEVER PERMITS. ─────────────────────────
//
// D2's ruling is about the pen — "the office's record cannot be reached — nothing
// was written, and nothing was lost" — and the same sentence is the right answer
// here for a sharper reason, which the port's own README states:
//
//   "the LIVE tier reads and this one PERMITS. A read tier that drops a row
//    answers with a number nobody can check; a guard that drops a row lets a
//    duplicate slug or a fourth parcel through, and the receipt for that arrives
//    at the next settlement."
//
// So there is NO silent fall-back to the 1.0 guard when the port cannot answer.
// A fall-back would be defensible on the runbook's own ROLLBACK sentence ("the
// 1.0 guards are still correct while the reverse mirror holds") — and it would
// still be wrong, because it would make the flip's failure mode INVISIBLE: the
// office would quietly validate against sqlite while every other receipt in the
// lane said Postgres. That is the split brain with a switch on it, wearing a
// fallback's coat.
//
// ── AND THE FLAG-OFF FALLBACK IS GONE TOO (G1 / POS-156, RULING 3a) ─────────
//
// `guardedLiveMarks`, `guardedLiveChildrenOf` and `guardedDraftsForKey` each
// read the sqlite journal when `W2_GUARDS` was not "1". That branch was the
// runbook's rollback — "Rollback here is REMOVING THE FLAG, deliberately, by a
// hand that knows it did so" — and it rested on the premise in the sentence
// above: "the 1.0 guards are still correct WHILE THE REVERSE MIRROR HOLDS."
//
// G1 removed the journal INSERT, so the mirror does not hold and the premise is
// repealed. A guard reading a journal nobody fills does not fail; it reads an
// EMPTY live layer, and this file's own next section says what that does:
// "PERMITS EVERYTHING — every duplicate slug, every parcel past the cap — with
// nothing on any page to show for it." A rollback that opens the town to
// duplicate slugs is not a rollback.
//
// So the three read the store unconditionally and refuse when it cannot be
// reached. This is not a new shape: THE HOLD SHELF'S READS below have run it
// since POS-153 — "there is no `guardsFlipped()` branch here and no sqlite
// fallback underneath" — on Everything Reads the Store's own sentence, that the
// flag is the disease. `guardedAttachments` KEEPS its flag, and the difference
// is the whole test: its fallback reads `dynamic.db/attachments`, a table G1
// does not touch, so its 1.0 arm still answers from a store that is still
// written.
//
// Prod runs `W2_GUARDS=1`, so nothing live changes on the day this lands; what
// goes is the ability to roll the read half back onto a store that no longer
// holds the rows. That went with the INSERT, not with this edit.
//
// ── THE HOUSEHOLD SPELLING, WHICH IS THE SEAM THAT BITES ────────────────────
//
// 1.0's guards are scoped by the household NAME (`resolvedWorldHousehold(key)`,
// the office key's own word — 'darko'). `claims.household` holds the RESOLVED KEY
// ('gh:67605380', 'solo:the-town'). `guard-reads.mjs` says this out loud in
// `DISCLOSURES.two_household_spellings`, and it is not cosmetic: a guard scoped
// by the wrong spelling reads an EMPTY live layer and then PERMITS EVERYTHING —
// every duplicate slug, every parcel past the cap — with nothing on any page to
// show for it. So every household-scoped read in this file goes through
// `householdKeyFor`, world2-claims.mjs's ONE resolver, inside the same
// transaction that declares `app.household` for 007's row policy. Nothing here
// may reach a household-scoped read any other way.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED, AND WHY ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `worldForStances` (world-stance.mjs) — declare-stance-on's candidate list — is
// named in the port's table and is NOT wired here. It is 1.0's one CROSS-
// household live read, and the port answers it structurally narrower.
// `DISCLOSURES.cross_household`, verbatim:
//
//   "a cross-household live read (household: null) is NARROWER than 1.0's by
//    exactly the other households' DRAFTS. 007's row policy makes a draft
//    visible only inside a transaction that named its household, and there is no
//    household to name here. 1.0's `worldForStances` deliberately surfaces
//    another household's sketch when it overlaps ground you hold — 'the ONE
//    place a sketch becomes visible to somebody who did not write it', which
//    the-late-welcome asks for. Under 007 that is not narrowable, it is
//    unrepresentable for office_api. WHICH LAW GIVES WAY IS A RULING, AND IT IS
//    NOT THIS PORT'S TO MAKE."
//
// It is not this module's to make either. Wiring it would silently delete
// the-late-welcome — a candidate list that got shorter, with every policy
// working exactly as written. Teed for the founder in the B1 report.
//
// ── RULED 2026-09-22 (Wright, G1 overnight RULING 2; POS-195) ──────────────
//
// NEITHER law gave way, and `worldForStances` is still NOT wired here — which
// is the part to notice before reaching for it. It reads the store through a
// THIRD credential, `stance_reader` (world2/schema/023_stance_reader.sql),
// whose own pool lives at `world2-acts.mjs § stanceQuery` and whose column
// list omits `claims.body`. Everything this module does stays on `office_api`,
// and `office_api` is still blind to another household's draft — here and
// everywhere. The disclosure above is therefore still true as written; only
// its last sentence has been answered.

// NOT A GUARD · the town's departure record, read from the store
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// POS-154, under Everything Reads the Store. `world-movement.mjs §
// storedDepartures` opened `dynamic.db` and folded the `movements` table for
// `GET /world/orient`, `/world/present`, `/world/walkers` and the say door's
// earshot. The rows are in `acts`, the derivation exists, and this is the wire —
// the same shape and the same reasons as the stands block below, so the two sit
// together rather than growing a second road apiece.
//
// ⚑ THE FOUNDING ERA IS EXCLUDED, and it is the one clause that cannot be left
// out. `DEPARTURE_ACTIONS` matches the backfilled walk ledger too, and era one
// ALREADY reaches every one of those callers by another road entirely —
// `world.mjs § departuresAcrossEras` parses `WORLD/walk-ledger.md` out of the
// clone and merges the two itself. Returning `_ledger` rows here would hand that
// merge the founding era twice, and `recordsAcrossEras`' own de-dupe could not
// see it: `dedupeRecords` keys on `era`, the clone's copy is stamped `ledger` and
// this one would be stamped `store`, so both survive and the LAST one wins. That
// is not a duplicate row in a list; it is a different resident's governing leg.
//
// ⚑ ONE CONVERTER, WHICH IS `live-reads`'. `departureRecordOf` reads all four
// pens (ledger / journal / live / movement-store) and REFUSES a row it cannot
// read rather than skipping it. Writing the mapping again here is the thing
// every file in this derivation forbids about itself, and a second copy would
// drift on exactly the pen nobody is looking at.
//
// ⚑ `strict` STAYS ON. A refused act throws out of `departureRecords`, this
// throws, and `storedDepartures` turns it into a named `absent` — which is the
// same bargain the sqlite read kept, where a payload that would not parse landed
// in its catch. An answer short by the rows nobody looks for is the one outcome
// neither store is allowed to produce.
//
// ⚑ NO FLAG. `guardedAttachments` carries a `W2_GUARDS` branch because a GUARD
// flipping is a thing an operator rolls back. This is a READ with one right
// answer, and a switch here would be the office keeping two answers to one
// question — the thing the project exists to stop.

// back by removing a flag. This is a READ with one right answer: the holding
// record lives in `acts`, the sqlite journal truncates at every drain, and a
// switch here would be the office maintaining two answers to one question —
// which is the thing the project exists to stop. Replace, never layer: there is
// no sqlite fallback under this and a store that cannot be read is an ABSENT
// block, which is the door's own ruled answer for an unreadable record.
//
// ⚑ ONE TRANSACTION, BOTH HALVES. `officeRead`'s `BEGIN READ ONLY` wraps the
// pair, so the holder and the set-down are read from one snapshot rather than
// from two the town may have moved between — and it is one round trip, not two.
//
// ⚑ DEC-4 GETS STRONGER, NOT WEAKER. The rule is that a read worker holds no
// writable handle; the old road held a read-only sqlite handle and closed it in
// a `finally`. This road opens no sqlite handle at all, and `BEGIN READ ONLY`
// makes "this never writes" a property Postgres enforces rather than one a
// comment asserts.
//
// ⚑ NOT WRAPPED IN `refusing`. `GuardsUnreachableError` carries the PEN's
// sentence — "nothing was written, and nothing was lost" — which is the wrong
// thing to say about a read that wrote nothing by construction. The caller's
// ruled answer for an unreadable record is an absent block, and it reaches that
// answer from any throw. So the port's own error travels, and the door's catch
// is the one place it becomes an answer.
