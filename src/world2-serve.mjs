// world2-serve.mjs — the door's WORLD 2.0 READ TIER (dev era).
//
// Phase 3c of the gold plan: the reads the site will consume, served straight
// from Postgres — freshness as a QUERY, not a pipeline (the staleness-sentinel
// class dies here, gold §2). Keyless like the 1.0 world read tier: the docket,
// standing marks, and window receipts are all public facts — the docket being
// PUBLIC is half the candle's point ("here is everything that locks at 17:45").
//
// Namespaced under /world2/* so nothing shadows a 1.0 route during the shadow
// era; at cutover these become the /world reads (and the bake pipeline dies).
// Role: the same office_api connection the shadow pens hold (SELECT is granted
// on everything).
//
// The placed/standing split (the seed lane's read-path note, resolved here):
//   /world2/marks          -> placed marks only (they have a where) — the map's read
//   /world2/marks?all=true -> the whole standing register incl. de-sited
//   A de-sited mark IS standing; a consumer that wants a `where` on every row
//   asks for the default.
//
// ── THE LIVE LANE (A/B gaps P-092 / P-093 / P-098 / P-036) ──────────────────
//
// /world2/walks · /world2/positions · /world2/present · /world2/say ·
// /world2/occupancy answer the questions the apex read shadows still answer out
// of sqlite. Every derivation is `world2/tools/live-reads.mjs` — 1.0's own law,
// ported, and held to the original by `falsifier-live-equality.mjs`. Nothing in
// THIS file derives anything: it queries, orders, and renders.
//
// Two shapes are load-bearing and easy to get wrong from here:
//
//   · the ORDER. Departure and passage reads MUST carry
//     `live-reads.DEPARTURE_ORDER_SQL`. `ORDER BY id` is silently wrong — the
//     backfill inserted the pre-journal era last, so 44 of 73 residents would
//     be handed a governing leg from July. `departureRecords` asserts it.
//   · the CLOCK. `?at=<ISO>` evaluates the whole answer at that instant; absent,
//     it is now. Position is a function of (record, clock) and nothing between
//     is stored, so any instant is answerable and none is cached.
//
// Keyless, like the rest of this tier and like 1.0's own equivalents:
// `world_walkers` is in mcp.mjs's PUBLIC set, and server.mjs serves
// GET /world/present keyless. These are public facts about a public town.

//               (world2/tools/mark-carried-backfill.mjs). Its `at` follows 1.0's

// A published mark with NO row (git could not answer for it, the backfill has

//
// CARRIED, NOT MERELY STANDING. The clearing materializes a locked claim into

// call a locked mark published. A mark whose newest claim is LOCKED at a window
// beyond the newest window a settlement closed has not been carried yet, and

  // the world clone's tags. Keyless, exactly as 1.0 is: which settlements have
  // landed is the most public fact the town has.
  //
  // THE DECISIONS ARE 1.0'S OWN, IMPORTED. `settlementsFrom` is the pure half
  // of `src/settlements.mjs` — which rows count, ordered by NUMBER and never by
  // date or by the order the store hands them over, `current` = the highest
  // number that landed, a gap left as the refusal it was, and the recent-list
  // cap. The store rows are rendered into the exact `{tag, sha, date}` lines
  // `readSettlementTags` produces from git, and handed to the same function, so
  // a changed rule moves both doors or neither. Nothing here decides anything.
  //
  // TWO REPRESENTATIONS DIFFER FROM 1.0 AND BOTH ARE SAID HERE:
  //   · `sha` is the WHOLE commit sha. 1.0 prints `rev-parse --short`, whose
  //     length is git's auto-abbreviation for the clone at hand (8 today) —
  //     a value that grows with the repo. The store keeps the commit whole and
  //     the twin serves it whole; 1.0's short is a prefix of it, always.
  //   · `date` is the same INSTANT rendered in UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. 1.0
  //     prints `%cI` in the COMMITTER's own offset — `-04:00` for the 37
  //     keeper-era tags (S1–S43, committed from an EDT machine), `Z` for the 34
  //     box-era ones. A timestamptz keeps the instant and not the offset. No
  //     day boundary moves: the latest EDT commit of any day is 16:08.
  //
  // WHAT THE STORE CARRIES THAT THE TAG LIST CANNOT is on each row beside 1.0's
  // three fields: `window` (the candle window that crossing closed; null for
  // every tag older than the store's first window) and `blessed_at` (the tag
  // object's own date — the keeper's bless, which 1.0 conflates with the push).
  //

// the contract the viewer speaks." Twelve /world2/* doors existed and this was
// not one of them, so every apex read shadow (P-016…P-034) still answered out
// of sqlite.
//
// ADDITIVE. The 1.0 apex is untouched, GET /world/apex keeps its route, and
// rollback is not routing to this one. Keyless, exactly as 1.0's spectator read
// is keyless — the spine, the salient marks and the affordances in force at a
// point are published-main facts, and S-09's whole difficulty is that the 1.0
// equivalent is "a public raw-GitHub read with no key; the door must serve an
// equivalent keyless read".
//
//   GET /world2/apex?x=<m>&y=<m>[&crossing=<n>][&law_sha=<sha>]
//
// ?law_sha= re-reads the SAME standpoint under a named law — the answer as it
// stood at a settled window. Absent, the pin resolves through
// apex-reads.mjs § lawShaFor and the answer says which rung it used.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, and it is the whole design:
//
//   the LAW half   (actions, granted, not_yours, actors) — composed from
//                  law_projection at ONE pinned law_sha and from nothing else.
//                  The runbook's NO-GO is exactly this: "terms composed from
//                  anything but law_projection … would rebuild the S39 class
//                  the projection exists to make catchable."
//   the WORLD half (within, nearby) — the world ENGINE's own orient and
//                  openYourEyes, run over a world assembled from marks + the
//                  skeleton law rows. 1.0's judgment, 2.0's data.
//   the LIVE half  (present) — live-reads.mjs, the port already on trial at
//                  /world2/present, rendered into the apex's near() shape.
//
// Each of the three says what it could NOT do, in `disclosed`, rather than
// answering as if it could.
//
// Exported as a function, not only as a route: the equality falsifier compares
// ANSWERS, and making it go through HTTP would put a server between the two
// derivations it is trying to hold to each other.

/**
 * `present`, in the apex's own shape.
 *
 * 1.0's apex reads this from `presentNear` -> `near()` (src/dynamic-presence.mjs),
 * which renders the position union against a radius and a cap. The UNION is
 * already ported (`live-reads.everyonePlaced`, on trial at /world2/present);
 * what is composed here is the RENDER — bearing, band, distance — out of the
 * engine's own vocabulary, "because a resident and a hill are described the
 * same way, in the same words".
 *
 * TWO FIELDS ARE NOT ANSWERED, and they are ABSENT rather than guessed:
 * `standing` and `aboard`. Both come from the FRAME fold (who is aboard the
 * vessel), which live-reads.mjs explicitly REFUSED to port — "the FRAME half is
 * refused, see § What is NOT here". A `false` in either would be a claim this
 * store cannot make, and it would be wrong on exactly the day somebody sails.
 *
 * ── ⚑ THE ROSTER, AND WHY THE DEFAULT IS THE NARROWER ONE ───────────────────
 *
 * `positionRoster` is a union of three terms — walk records, parcel households,
 * and THE TOWN ROLL — and the third is Keemin's 2026-08-29 ruling, because a
 * narrower roster "does not answer wrongly, it leaves residents unasked about"
 * (#1864). `/world2/present` passes it.
 *
 * 1.0's APEX DOES NOT. `world.mjs § worldOrient` calls
 * `presentNear(at, { place, exclude, repo: WORLD_CLONE, world: w })` — no
 * `roll:` — so `near()` takes its `roll = []` default and the apex's presence
 * block is the two-term union. The standalone `GET /world/present` gets the
 * roll (server.mjs passes `townRoll()`); the apex block does not. Measured at
 * the quay 2026-09-03: 1 resident with the apex's roster, 49 with the roll,
 * because every roll handle with no walk and no parcel falls to the PORCH and
 * the porch IS the quay.
 *
 * That is a 1.0 inconsistency, not a 2.0 choice, and this door is additive: its
 * GO is being field-for-field equal to `GET /world/apex`. So the default
 * REPRODUCES 1.0's roster and `?roster=roll` serves the ruling's wider one,
 * with the answer saying which it used. Baking the wider roster into the
 * default would have made the new door disagree with the old one by 48
 * residents at the town's front door and called it a fix.
 */
// EXPORTED for the reason `world2Apex` itself gives one screen up — "the

// a server between the two derivations it is trying to hold to each other". The

// #2900's cross-tier equality is about; a law fixture built only to reach this
