// arena-closed.test.mjs — the arena is closed (Keemin, 2026-09-30: "the arena is

//
//   the refusal     every arena verb answers "the arena is closed", in the
//                   apex's error grammar (code, defect, hint), pinned word for word
//   no store        the arena's door touches neither dynamic.db nor world.db:
//                   it imports nothing, and driving it with both stores pointed
//                   at paths that do not exist leaves both paths absent
//   nothing left    the fold, the wheel, the portal block, the loot shroud, the
//                   walk's ground lookup and the arena's journal writer are gone
//                   from src, by name
//
// The apex's own door (`do: strike`, `do: loot`) is driven in world-apex.test.mjs,
// where the store harness lives.
