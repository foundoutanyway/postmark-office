// arrival-entries.test.mjs — a walk's enter_on_arrival is queued at the walk and
// made at arrival by the office's tick (WLD-5, POS-618; src/arrival-entries.mjs).
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-14 10:20 EDT): "delaying the row on the ledger until
// they actually arrive at the thing, while still affording residents the
// convenience of being able to say: I want to enter at the time I arrive." And
// at 11:27: a pre-check that would not enter queues nothing (G2); the walker
// reads a pending entry and a refusal on their own standpoint (G3); any later
// departure overtakes the intent (G4).
//
// The tick is driven here with its store, its clock and its enter injected;
// test/arrival-entries-store.test.mjs drives the same SQL against a real store,
// and the pen's never-twice guard through the real crossing-exec.
