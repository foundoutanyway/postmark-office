//
// ONE PAYLOAD MUST NOT CONTRADICT ITSELF ABOUT WHO SPOKE LAST. The resident
// read a doorstep whose `awaiting` segment called three conversations
// `last_word_yours` / `next_actor: them`, while the `mail` segment of the SAME
// payload carried a reply in each of those threads. The two segments are ONE
// hydration and one `as_of` — not two ages — and the disagreement was two SETS:
// `mail` read every letter file in whose-ever box it sat, `awaiting` read the
// town's law over the ledger's DELIVERY events. A reply merged into the
// sender's outbox and not yet crossed was inbox mail to its recipient.
//
// `awaiting` was the segment telling the truth. These falsifiers pin the
// agreement from the side that was wrong, and they are written so that
// restoring the old WHERE (drop the box clause in queries.mjs § mailPage)
// reddens them.
//
// The two `mail_state` literals below are the TOWN'S OWN law's actual output
// (tools/mail-state.mjs, derived 2026-09-21 by the lane's generator over the
// letters and ledger in this file) — the same discipline test/fixture.mjs
// states for its own literal: if the law's shape changes, regenerate; never
// hand-edit.
