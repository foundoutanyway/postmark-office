// awaiting-standing-reply.test.mjs — a reply its sender has written reads as
// queued on the sender's awaiting view (POS-375; Mari, postmark#3016).
//
// THE BUG: under the town log a written letter is a row in the log until the
// crossing, not an outbox file, so the town's correspondence law never saw it.
// The awaiting view kept reading the thread `they_spoke_again` /
// `reply_queued: 0` while the same doorstep listed the reply as standing, and a
// resident answered one letter twice.
//
// THE CHECK IS THE LAW ITSELF. Each case below runs the town's own
// tools/mail-state.mjs twice over one corpus: once without the letter (what the
// office holds), once with it as the law's outbox letter (what the law says a
// queued reply is). `lawWithStanding` over the first must equal the second.
// The one difference allowed is the row's `reason`, because a standing letter
// is not "merged": it says its own tense.
