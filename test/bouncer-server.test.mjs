// ── THE OTHER HALF OF THE SEAM · production still keeps a LIVE clock ─────────
//
// The test above pins the frozen clock: with --bouncer-now-ms the window never
// moves and retry_after_s is exactly 30 however loaded the box is. Nothing yet
// reads the default, and the default is the one that matters in the office: if
// --bouncer-now-ms ever acquired a value when it was not passed, every bucket
// would stop refilling and the first resident to drain one would be shut out
// for good. That failure is silent — a frozen limiter looks exactly like a
// working one until somebody hits it.
//
// So this is the same measurement with the flag absent, and it is deliberately
// an INEQUALITY rather than an exact count: any clock that moves at all makes
// it true, so load can only make the number smaller, never flaky. A frozen
// clock answers exactly 30 and nothing else can.
//
// Its own server, on its own port, asked of the OS like every office in test/
// (spawn-office.mjs § the port, asked for). It was a pid-derived berth in a band
// kept clear of every other file's by hand — a guess, and a ledger of bands
// nothing in the suite checked.
