// candy-and-chest-at-the-door.test.mjs — WLD-27 at the placement door.
//
// Wright, 2026-10-13T00:09Z: candy stays OFF the resident whitelist — a
// resident placing a fresh `class: candy` mark is refused — while the drop's
// own road (world-units.mjs hands `dropUnit` to `leaveMarkViaOffice`) passes the
// class gate for the unit it set down, and only that unit. A chest is
// resident-instantiable, with capacity 1..120, portable true/false and an
// open/closed welcome.
//
// The class layer is a SYNTHETIC law snapshot, published through
// `reloadLawSnapshot`'s own query seam, so the roster gate answers as it would
// on the record; there is no world clone, so a write that passes the gates
// fails later — the assertions are about WHICH sentence comes back.
