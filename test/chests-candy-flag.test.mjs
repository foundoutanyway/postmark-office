// chests-candy-flag.test.mjs — WLD-27's chest and candy doors ship dark by default (src/chests-candy.mjs).
//
// Office #499 (WLD-27) built chests and candy on candy LABELS and is merged
// into train/2026-w43; Darko ruled the label version out, and at 12:56 on
// 2026-10-16: "#499 still needs a fallback". OFF unless WORLD_CHESTS_CANDY=1:
//   1. the counted-unit door (take/give/drop by label, consume, refill)
//      refuses in the office's own words, before it reads anything;
//   2. a resident's chest (leave_mark { class: "chest" }) refuses;
//   3. the reads offer nothing: GET /world/chests answers no chest;
//   4. the tick's first stock writes nothing, and says why.
// ON (=1) is exactly #499's behaviour, which its own tests hold
// (candy-and-chest-at-the-door, chest-stock, chests-hold-things, world-units,
// bevel-exit-boundaries all run with the flag open).
//
// THE FLIP: make chestsCandyOn answer true by default and § 1–4 go red.
