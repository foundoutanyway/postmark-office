// chests-hold-things.test.mjs — WLD-27, Bevel's first review (2026-10-13).
//
// Four boundary findings and one scope correction, each held here by a test
// that fails on the submitted head (01abca91) and passes on the correction:
//   1. a take-back refused for the carry cap returns NO stake first;
//   2. a failed withdrawal of an exited mark is tried again on retry — and
//      only the withdrawal: no second unit, no second return;
//   3. a failed set-down's compensation cannot leave 25 carried when another
//      hold reached for the freed slot while the mark was filing;
//   4. a carried chest is on its CARRIER's card (and still on its maker's);
//   5. a chest takes whole THINGS too: they share its one capacity, show in
//      what it holds (101 candies and a toaster read 102 things), leave the
//      carrier's load, and come out by a take aimed at the chest.
// Everything is synthetic and in memory: the record, the ledger, the pens.
