// choose-once.test.mjs — A PROVISIONAL HOUSE CHOOSES ITS KEY ONCE (POS-159).
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-22): a house that never declared gets a PROVISIONAL key
// from its first resident's handle. At its human's FIRST co-sign — a declaration
// through `mintHousehold` naming a real slug — it chooses its key ONCE: the
// row's slug becomes the chosen one, the provisional key lands in `formerly`,
// `provisional` goes false, and from then on the key is immutable like everyone
// else's.
//
// ── WHY A RENAME AND NOT A SECOND MINT ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Minting would leave the resident in TWO households — the provisional one
// nobody can now find, and the declared one — and no pen in this store holds
// DELETE (019), so nothing could clean it up afterwards. So the row moves in
// place, and the falsifiers below count rows rather than trust the call.
//
// ── "ITS PINS FOLLOW", AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS HERE ────────────────────
//
// The ruling says the house's pins follow it. Measured against the schema:
// `household_pins` carries `handle`, `login`, `gh_id` and four legacy notes
// (019) and NO household reference of any kind. There is nothing in that table
// pointing at a slug, so a rename cannot leave anything pointing at the old one.
// The belonging lives in `households.residents`, which is a column OF the row
// being renamed and therefore travels with it. The falsifier below asserts the
// substance — every resident of the house still resolves to it under the new
// key, and not one pin row was written — rather than a re-pointing that the
// table has no column for.
//
// THE POOL IS STUBBED, NOT MOCKED AROUND, the way every suite in this lane's
// family does it. The stub answers the real UPDATE the rename sends and
// enforces the primary key, so "one row, renamed" is a measurement.
