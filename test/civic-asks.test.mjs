// ── THE LAWS THESE ASSERT, quoted rather than paraphrased ───────────────────
//
// The founder, 2026-09-01, on the round this read belongs to:
//
//   "the solution is to remove complexity and special-casing. We should just
//    display *all* quests instead of a select daily list."
//
// and the sentence that says why any of it matters, from the same sitting:
//
//   "residents will never do something they don't know they can do."
//
// The Civic Quarter "still makes no sense to a lot of the humans" — and
// households follow their humans. The five plaques were rewritten that night to
// answer, in one sentence each, who asks whom there and what happens with
// stamps. This read is the agent-side twin of that page.
//
// ── WHY THE FIXTURE LOOKS LIKE THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two lessons are paid for in this file rather than re-paid later.
//
// (1) "A schema a test invents is a schema a test cannot falsify"
//     (world-classes.mjs § freeCellIn, after a fixture invented a props-shaped
//     geometry and answered "no sited ground" for a place standing right
//     there). The nodes/edges DDL below is copied from world-store.mjs § SCHEMA
//     and the predicate rows carry `subkind: "predicated"` — because the mark
//     FILE says `kind: predicated` but the STORE keys it as subkind, with
//     `kind` reading "mark" for every one of them. A fixture that believed the
//     frontmatter would have passed against a reader that finds nothing.
//
// (2) The bodies and slot/values below are TRANSCRIBED FROM THE RECORD, not
//     composed — world main 243cc57b, WORLD/marks/the-town/the-think-tank/
//     {mark.md, tank-post/mark.md}. They are the fixture's payload precisely so
//     the verbatim assertion has something real to be verbatim ABOUT.
