// consent-door-household.test.mjs — THE CONSENT DOOR'S STANDING-SCOPED DO
// (postmark#2392, founder-ruled 2026-09-02).
//
// The defect these falsify: `declare-stance-on` was unreachable at the world
// apex for every standpoint that exists. The verb is granted by the `household`
// class node; the apex delivers a grant through `yours` (the class you ARE —
// `resident`) or `here` (a class mark on ground in reach). A household is a
// STANDING entity: nobody is one, and none is sited — zero marks of kind
// `household` in the whole world record — so both rails were dead and the
// bounce read "afforded at the-town/household (null, null) — walk there and it
// appears", which is a direction to nowhere.
//
// Every test quotes the law it asserts, verbatim:
//
//   the-town/declare-stance-on   the class mark (constitution tier, v5):
//                                "A stance is a revisable word on an edge —
//                                 welcomed or opposed, latest wins; neutral is
//                                 never stored, it is absence. The ground's
//                                 holder speaks."
//   the .1 ruling (2026-08-25)   world-stance.mjs § the fourth tier: "what
//                                awaits your word … is derived from what you
//                                HOLD (`stanceInbox` keys on `key.handles` and
//                                nothing else), never from where your feet
//                                are."
//   ONE DERIVATION, TWO DOORS    ibid.: "This wraps `stanceShadow` and never
//                                re-implements it" — the rule the DO now obeys
//                                for `declareStanceViaOffice`.
//   the door's own contract      household-apex.mjs § HOUSEHOLD_DESCRIPTION:
//                                a card is "read back for any act BY ITS OWN
//                                NAME".
//   the pen flip (W2_PEN)        world-stance.mjs § LANE ONE: "Unreachable
//                                Postgres = the ruled refusal, and nothing was
//                                written."

// state on first use, so once this test has built a pool against an unreachable
// address that pool is what the module holds for the rest of the process. It
// wants no Postgres — the point is that there ISN'T one — but it does leave the
// module dirty, so nothing may run after it.

  // knocked. This uses no Postgres at all: the lane is flipped and pointed at a
  // port nothing listens on, so `penWrite` throws PenUnreachableError exactly

  // ⚠ WHICH failure gets there depends on the box, and the test is written not
  // to care. `pool()` does `await import("pg")` before it dials: where the

  // not (package.json declares `pg`; a dev box may not have installed it) it is

  // is the seam under test — the door's refusal reaching the caller with
