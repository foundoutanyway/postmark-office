// creatures-hook.test.mjs — the hook: every act door perceives creatures, and a
// walk is seen when it lands (POS-637 PR-B; src/act-watch.mjs, src/creatures-hook.mjs).
//
// RULED (Darko, Sitting E 2026-10-14 21:31): every ordinary public act a
// resident takes inside a creature's ring has an effect, and the reaction comes
// back in the actor's own answer. RULED (C1–C6, 2026-10-15 12:09 EDT): the walk
// is seen both when it's declared and when it lands; the answer carries the
// line, the reaction, the roll and judged_by. Settled (Wright, W1–W10): the hook
// wraps the act implementations, the answer waits at most 1 s, and no store
// connection is held across Jev.
//
// The law is the world's own (tools/creature-kind.mjs from the pinned clone)
// over a real kind file's text, as test/creatures.test.mjs reads it. The store,
// the judge and the world reads are injected; test/creatures-hook-store.test.mjs
// drives the pen, the watch and the reaction's row on a real Postgres.
