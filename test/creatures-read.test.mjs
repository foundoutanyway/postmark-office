// who and find:; a reaction stands in happening_here for 30 min within 500 m;
// one line names the nearest creature within 5 km; the walk's arrival reaches
// the walker's own happened. The fold, the law (the world's own, over a real
// kind file's text) and the engine's bearing words are the real ones; the
// record is injected.
