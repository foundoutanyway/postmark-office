//
// ── WHAT IS UNDER TEST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `WORLD/households.json` is the World's only knowledge of which handles form
// one household. It is an export of this office's resolver, and it was written
// into the world by hand: the tool's own header said the refresh was "the
// caller's act". Nobody was that caller after 2026-08-07, and thirty-three days
// later the file named 101 handles while the town named 157.
//
// Three readers take it as live — the fold's parcel-claim cap, the lint's
// consent gate, and the AUTHORSHIP WALL. The first two accept `--households`
// and can be pointed somewhere better. The wall cannot, and it fails silently:
// `settlement-sweep.mjs` leaves a sketchbook it cannot bind ALONE rather than
// refusing it. A stale registry there is not a wrong answer, it is no answer,
// under a receipt that reads exactly like a clean crossing.
//
// So `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` now re-derives the registry at the start of
// every crossing, from the town clone it pinned, and commits it ahead of the
// fold when the mapping moved.
//
// ── THE LAW THIS ASSERTS AGAINST, VERBATIM ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `postmark-world tools/settlement-sweep.mjs`, the authorship wall:
//
//     the wall binds a mark only when `households[record.by]` AND
//     `logins[branchName]` both resolve
//
// Both halves come out of this one file. A handle the registry has never heard
// of fails the first; a sketchbook name its `logins` map cannot bind fails the
// second. The tests below evaluate that conjunction over THE REGISTRY THE
// CROSSING ACTUALLY PUBLISHED — read back out of the fixture's bare origin, not
// out of the working clone — because a registry that never reached origin is a
// registry no PR lane and no later crossing will ever read.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// F2 is the control and it is the reason to believe F1. It runs the identical
// crossing with `SETTLEMENT_REGISTRY=0` — the one seam — and asserts the wall's
// conjunction FAILS for the same handle. Without it, F1 is an assertion that has
// never been shown capable of going red, which is a green light wired to
// nothing: every other fixture value would satisfy it just as well.
