// deferral-tripwire.test.mjs — the cursor may pass a settled row or a judged
// row, and never a deferred one.
//
//   node --test test/deferral-tripwire.test.mjs
//
// THE INVARIANT. planTownDrain sorts every pending join row into three piles and
// they are three different sentences: `settle` is DRAINED, `skipped` is JUDGED
// AND DONE ("not a settling act", "no handle on the row", "already stands in the
// white pages"), and `waiting` is DEFERRED — the pile the founder's tier line
// created, whose whole meaning is "not yet, and nothing is lost".
//
// Only the third makes a promise, so only the third can be broken, and until
// this file it was broken by construction: runTownDrain advances the cursor to
// `head` — the last PENDING row — whatever pile a row landed in. A deferred row
// was therefore reported as waiting and then walked past forever. That is not
// merely dropping a household; it is dropping one while printing the word that
// says it was kept, and the tier line's deferral says out loud to the resident
// "nothing about your standing expires".
//
// TWO MECHANISMS KEEP THE INVARIANT AND THEY COMPOSE. The gangway FREEZES the
// cursor over the rows it defers (test/gangway-drain.test.mjs, G4-G6). Every
// other deferral REFUSES the crossing here. T4 is the falsifier that proves
// they compose rather than fight.
//
// ── WHY THIS CANNOT FIRE FROM A DOOR TODAY ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The other deferral is the tier line: a row with no verified GitHub id and no
// co-sign. No live door can write one, and T5/T6 assert the two halves of that
// rather than leaving it as a claim in a comment:
//
//   · both join doors carry the identity fence in the same function as their
//     append and above it — declare.mjs § "11 — the anchor" and residency.mjs §
//     requestResidency both throw 403 before any row is written;
//   · and the berth arc opens no window either, because `household do: "begin"`
//     PARKS its declaration on the berth row and writes no journal row at all
//     ("nothing is executed until the click"), while the co-sign runs that
//     parked declaration under the human's just-verified identity — so the row
//     is BORN anchored rather than becoming anchored later.
//
// That is what makes the tripwire cheap rather than pointless: it costs nothing
// on every real crossing, and it is the thing standing between a future door
// that relaxes the fence (or a hand-run migration, or a restored backup — the
// foreign-class tripwire's own stated reasons) and a household eaten in silence.
