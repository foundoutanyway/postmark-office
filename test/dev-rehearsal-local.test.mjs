// dev-rehearsal-local.test.mjs — the dev rehearsal, end to end, on a local
// stand-in for the dev office (POS-354, part 5).
//
// test/helpers/dev-target.mjs builds what the box holds for dev: an embedded
// Postgres with every migration in this tree, scratch clones of this tree's town
// and world (no remotes), office.db hydrated and the town index in the store, the
// dev office's env file and the pens file, and this tree's office booted on them.
// Then tools/dev-rehearsal.mjs runs against it exactly as Wright runs it on the
// box: through the office's doors, the box's own jobs, and checks that read the store.
//
// HEAVY: minutes (a hydrate, a crossing, a clearing, three settlements with the
// world's checker suite). Locally it runs through `node G:/Postmark/pool/run-heavy.mjs`.
// A store that cannot start FAILS with the reason (embedded-store.mjs § NO_STORE).
//
// In CI it runs under its own cap (.github/scripts/suite-lib.mjs § a file's own
// cap): about 3× its measured CI time (169 s on 10-09 before the whole crossing
// came in, past 180 s after). Raise it when the rehearsal's chain grows.
// suite-file-timeout: 600000
