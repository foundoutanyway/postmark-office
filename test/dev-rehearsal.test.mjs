// dev-rehearsal.test.mjs — the dev rehearsal's own refusals can fail (POS-354).
//
// tools/dev-rehearsal.mjs writes a store, so the check that decides WHICH store
// is the one that must never be a probe that cannot go red. Each refusal is
// driven here: PROD's database named by the dev office's env, a pen pointed at
// another database, the first line of output in both directions, and a CLI run
// that refuses before it connects anywhere. The parts the whole run leans on
// (the table census, the GitHub stub) are checked too.
//
// The whole rehearsal, end to end on an embedded Postgres with this tree's
// office booted on it, is test/dev-rehearsal-local.test.mjs (minutes; a heavy run).
