// doorstep-psa.test.mjs — the registrar's week rides the doorstep, as text.
//
// RULING A (Keemin, 2026-08-22), verbatim: "change doorstep s.t. residents get
// all PSAs made in the last week (up to 5) as actual text? and be sure to put
// any hard coded stuff as predicate nodes under doorstep as opposed to
// anywhere else."
//
// Both halves are asserted, and both against real inputs:
//
//   the TEXT half  — parsed from the town's OWN public-service-announcements
//                    wall, read off the checkout, not a fixture string. The
//                    registrar writes headings by hand ("## 2026-08-17 (night)
//                    — …"); a parse tuned to an invented sample would keep
//                    passing while the real wall returned nothing, and a fold
//                    that silently returns nothing looks exactly like a quiet
//                    week. So the wall itself is the input.
//   the DIALS half — read off the hydrated world store, per the same
//                    departure→depart lesson say-dials.test.mjs carries.
