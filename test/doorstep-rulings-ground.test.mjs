// doorstep-rulings-ground.test.mjs — the second axis, through the DOOR.
//
// THE PROMISE, verbatim, from `src/household-apex.mjs § HOUSEHOLD_READS.rulings`
// — a sentence this lane wrote and this lane did not keep:
//
//   "what the last crossings RULED on your things — every mark of yours, AND
//    EVERY MARK LAID OVER GROUND YOU HOLD, that went forward onto the docket or
//    was ruled on."
//
// and the commit that added the door, arguing its own scoping on the same axis:
//
//   "a narrower default hides a housemate's refusal from the house that shares
//    the ground"
//
// ── WHAT WAS WRONG, AND WHY THE PURE TEST COULD NOT SEE IT ────────────────
//
// `test/since-claim-effects.test.mjs` proves `claimEffectsFrom` handles the
// ground axis, by handing it `onMyGround` directly. It passes, and it always
// would have: the PURE function was never the broken half. `doorstepRulings`
// called `readClaimEffects` with no `onMyGround` at all, so the axis died two
// layers above the function that was tested — structurally, in two places:
//
//   `claimRowsSince(since, { claimants, slugs: [] })`  — the rows never left
//                                                        the store
//   `if (!isMine && !onGround) continue`               — and any that did were
//                                                        dropped
//
// So this file tests the DOOR, not the derivation. The first assertion is about
// the ARGUMENTS that reach the store, because that is the half a pure test can
// never reach and the half that was empty.
//
// THE STORE IS A RECORDING STUB, and that is not a shortcut. There is no lab
// store — the box's `world2_dev` is prod — so "which slugs did the door ask
// for" is a question about this office that no database can answer better.
