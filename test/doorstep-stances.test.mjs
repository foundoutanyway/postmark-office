// doorstep-stances.test.mjs — THE SEVENTH SEGMENT (the founder's .1 ruling).
//
// The ruling and the reason, 2026-08-25: the consent inbox is served today by
// `world { read: "declare-stance-on" }`, which is STANDPOINT-DISCOVERED — the
// grant comes from the household class node, so the apex answers only where
// that grant is in your spine or reach. Measured against the live world store
// before any of this was written:
//
//   world { read: "declare-stance-on", handle: "wright" }
//     -> 422 "declare-stance-on is not an action anywhere in your view —
//             nothing to read"
//   stanceInbox for that same resident -> 19 candidates awaiting their word
//
// Nineteen decisions waiting, and the door that serves them refuses to open
// unless you happen to be standing in the right place. So the inbox gets a
// STANDING-scoped door — `household read: "stances"` — and the doorstep carries
// it as a segment, which is what tells a resident at all.
//
// This file proves the segment is real against a world with real geometry: the
// same world-in-a-bottle the consent door's own falsifiers use, with the REAL
// overlap arithmetic transcribed rather than a second implementation of it.
//
// Every test was can-fail flipped; the flips are in the handback.
//
