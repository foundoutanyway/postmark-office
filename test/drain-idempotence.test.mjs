// drain-idempotence.test.mjs — #2302: a logged paper act replays at the

// becomes a delete.
//
//   node --test test/drain-idempotence.test.mjs
//
// ── THE LAW THIS FILE HOLDS, QUOTED ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// town-updates.mjs § logPaperAct states the drain's whole contract in one
// sentence, and every falsifier below is that sentence made checkable:
//
//   "The row carries the door's arguments VERBATIM, because the drain's whole
//    contract is that replaying them through the door reproduces the commit."
//
// REPRODUCES the commit. Not "makes a new and different one". That holds only
// while the file is what it was when the door read it, and until this fix
// nothing checked that it was.
//
// ── THE INSTANCE, ON THE RECORD ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The postmaster's own card, 2026-08-30/31, three commits in the town repo:
//
//   23827b01  avatar set through the door — PROFILE.md founded, `avatar:` only
//   c8235671  four fields hand-added to WHITE_PAGES/postmaster/PROFILE.md
//             (road #1 of TOWN_BULLETIN/build-your-profile.md, which
//             self-certifies by design — hand-editing your own card is a
//             first-class road the town advertises)
//   63a38162  12:00:24Z, exactly at the crossing — the replay DELETED all four,
//             under updateProfileUnlogged's own commit wording rather than a
//             settler's, `avatar:` and the body untouched
//
// The middle step is a resident doing what the bulletin tells them to do. The
// third is the office eating it. F1 below is that sequence, end to end.
//
// ── WHAT MUST NOT BE TRADED FOR IT ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The cursor advances LAST, after the record is durable, so a crash between the
// commit and the advance leaves already-written rows still pending and the next
// crossing replays them. That replay is the whole reason the log survives a
// crash, and a guard that skipped it would trade data loss for LOST ACTS. F3
// and F4 are that half: a row whose work is not in this clone's history still
// replays, and a row that carries no outcome at all (every row written before
// this fix) replays exactly as it did.
