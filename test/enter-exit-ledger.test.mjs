// enter-exit-ledger.test.mjs — the passages are DERIVED, and a passage that was
// written can be read back.
//
// ── THE BUG THESE ANSWER TO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Since the 2026-08-24 single-log cutover the enter/exit acts write a journal
// row and the ledger FILE stopped growing. Both occupancy readers still read
// the file. Measured on prod 2026-08-26: `/api/world/dynamic` answered
// `journal: 39, journal_drained_through: null` while the file, the box's serving
// clone and the office door all still served the same last line from
// 2026-08-24T19:39:13Z. Every passage in between succeeded, was recorded, and
// showed nowhere.
//
// ── THE LAW, QUOTED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `the-town/enter`, class, constitution tier, version 4, source LOGOS/classes.md:
//
//     "An entry is one passage written — who crossed, into what, at a threshold
//      you truly stand before; exit writes the next, to the effective parent."
//
// `the-town/consent-at-thresholds`, class, constitution tier, version 1:
//
//     "Presence is free, effect is consented: entry meets the ground's own law,
//      silence welcomes, only the town's pen bars a leaving, refusals name
//      horizons."
//
// The first sentence is what the end-to-end falsifier below asserts: WRITTEN.
// A passage the record holds and no reader can reach is not written, it is
// buried. The second is what the consent-word falsifier asserts: the mark's
// answer is the effect's whole warrant, so a derivation that drops it would
// leave every passage unconsented and every refusal unrecorded.
//
// ── AND WHERE THE LIVE ERA NOW COMES FROM (POS-194, G1 gate 1 of 3) ─────────
//
// This module was the LAST live-era reader of the sqlite journal's enter/exit
// rows — the one STOP that held G1 shut. It reads `acts` now, and the sqlite
// read is DELETED rather than flagged.
//
// So the fixture below seeds A STORE, not a journal, and `dynamic.db` is not
// opened anywhere in this file except by the equality falsifier that exists to
// compare the two sources. Every other test here is green with NO JOURNAL TABLE
// IN EXISTENCE, which is the property G1 needs and the reason the fixture moved
// rather than being taught to write both.
//
// ⚑ WHICH TESTS DISCRIMINATE, said here so nobody reads a page of green as a
// page of guards. Restoring the sqlite read (docs/2026-09-22/rail/pos-194/
// flip.sh) reds E1/E2/E3 (the equality falsifier), S1/S2 (the source pins) and
// every case whose passages exist only in the store — which is all of them,
// because the journal table is never created. The three that would survive a
// restored sqlite read are the PURE halves (`journalLinesIn`,
// `deriveEnterExitLedger`, `frozenLinesIn`): they take rows as arguments and
// have no source at all, which is exactly why the port could not break them.
