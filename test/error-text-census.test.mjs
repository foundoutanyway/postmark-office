// error-text-census.test.mjs — every place src/ turns an error's own text
// (`.message`, `.stderr`) into a string is counted, file by file, and each count
// says why it is allowed (POS-573, POS-578).
//
// POS-568 took the raw error out of the REST doors' 5xx answers; POS-573 and
// POS-578 took it out of the MCP door and out of every module that built its
// own 5xx hint or defect from one (fault-words.mjs § faultLogged: the detail goes
// to the log, the resident reads FAULT_LOGGED). Those sites were found by
// grep, and the next one will be written by someone who did not read either
// issue. So this file is the grep, kept: it counts every line in src/ that
// reads an error's text and is not a log line, and holds each file to the
// count below. A new line fails here until someone decides which kind it is:
//
//   · an ANSWER'S hint or defect (a refusal, a 5xx): never; use faultLogged;
//   · a DISCLOSURE in a 200 read ("…could not be read (<reason>) — unknown,
//     not zero"): never the error's text; since POS-657 (RULED A, Darko
//     2026-10-16 20:04 EDT) its reason is fault-words.mjs § plainReason's,
//     and the raw error goes to the log;
//   · an OPERATOR's tool, pass or panel, or what a household's OWN URL
//     answered (G4): the raw text stays, and the line says which;
//   · the office's OWN words (PenUnreachableError's and LateCrossingError's
//     messages are ruled sentences), a refusal relayed by its own defect, or
//     plumbing that never reaches an answer (a classifier, a status field an
//     operator reads, a log variable).
//
// THE FLIP, per module: put any fixed site back (e.g. gangway-door.mjs's
// `hint: String(e.stderr ?? e.message ?? e)`) and its file's count goes up here.
//
