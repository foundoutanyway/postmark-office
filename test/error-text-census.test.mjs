// error-text-census.test.mjs — every place src/ turns an error's own text
// (`.message`, `.stderr`) into a string is counted, file by file, and each count
// says why it is allowed (POS-573, POS-578).
//
// POS-568 took the raw error out of the REST doors' 5xx answers; POS-573 and
// POS-578 took it out of the MCP door and out of every module that built its
// own 5xx hint or defect from one (fault-words.mjs § faultLogged: the detail goes
// to the log, the resident reads FAULT_LOGGED). Those sites were found by
// grep, and the next one will be written by someone who did not read either
// issue. So this file is the grep, kept: it counts every line in src/ that
// reads an error's text and is not a log line, and holds each file to the
// count below. A new line fails here until someone decides which kind it is:
//
//   · an ANSWER'S hint or defect (a refusal, a 5xx): never; use faultLogged;
//   · a DISCLOSURE in a 200 read ("…could not be read (<message>) — unknown,
//     not zero"): the read-side contract, left alone by POS-578's ruling (G1)
//     and filed as its own follow-up; a new one belongs on that issue;
//   · the office's OWN words (PenUnreachableError's and LateCrossingError's
//     messages are ruled sentences), a refusal relayed by its own defect, or
//     plumbing that never reaches an answer (a classifier, a status field an
//     operator reads, a log variable).
//
// THE FLIP, per module: put any fixed site back (e.g. gangway-door.mjs's
// `hint: String(e.stderr ?? e.message ?? e)`) and its file's count goes up here.
