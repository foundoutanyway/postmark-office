// comment): 5 stamps, once per household, receipt = the household's first
// published idea mark; idempotent BY LEDGER; the writer holds the window; one
// authority for town law (the clone's own engine, or a named refusal).
//
// The engine under test is the TOWN TRAIN's own stamp-mint (the rule's first
// home), via STAMP_ENGINE_DIR — real law, no fakes. The engine-predates
// falsifier points at a pre-rule engine and must be refused BY NAME.
