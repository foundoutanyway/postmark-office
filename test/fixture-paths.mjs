// fixture-paths.mjs — where the town and the world checkouts are, on ANY machine.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (postmark#2980 / POS-131, measured 2026-09-19/21):
// suites resolved their fixture checkout by naming an absolute path on one
// operator's disk — `G:/postmark/seam-overnight/town-clone`, `G:/Wright-HQ/postmark`,
// `G:/Postmark/repo-clones/wright/postmark-world`, and a `process.cwd()/../postmark-world`
// that means a different directory in every tree. A fresh pool tree therefore
// opened dozens of reds that said nothing whatever about the office, and the
// reds that WERE about the office sat inside that noise.
//
// THIS IS NOT A NEW IDIOM. Five suites already carried the right one — office
// a59976f, "fallback paths follow", and `next-steps.test.mjs`'s list. This is
// that idiom written once instead of twenty-eight times, each drifting.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE OFFICE'S OWN, deliberately: `src/households.mjs` for the
// town (`TOWN_CLONE` env, else `<office>/town-clone`) and
// `src/world-store.mjs § WORLD_CLONE` for the world (`WORLD_CLONE` env, else
// `<office>/world-clone`, else the sibling `<office>/../postmark-world`). A
// suite that resolved its checkout differently from the code it tests could be
// pointed at one town while the office read another, and every answer would
// look plausible.
//
// THE ONE DIFFERENCE FROM `src/`: these answer `null` when there is no
// checkout, where src answers a path that does not exist. A test needs that
// difference. "No clone" is a SKIP WITH ITS REASON PRINTED, not a red, and
// never a path onto a machine that is not this one — a suite that reds because
// another operator's disk is missing has measured the disk, not the office.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not check that the directory is the RIGHT
// checkout. Each suite keeps its own marker test (`quest-registry.json`,
// `tools/quest-progress.mjs`, `WORLD/world-state.json`, `tools/enter-exit.mjs`),
// because the marker is part of what that suite is asserting and belongs with
// its assertions, not here.
//
// THE CLONES ARE SPARSE (POS-652): only the paths test/clone-sparse.json names are
// checked out, and test/helpers/sparse-guard.mjs makes a read, probe or listing outside
// them fail loudly, naming the path to add. The guard is loaded for EVERY suite by the
// runner (`npm test` and the lanes' `node --import ./test/helpers/sparse-guard.mjs --test
// …`, and NODE_OPTIONS on CI); about sixty suites read the clones without this file.
// Importing it here as well is only a belt for a bare `node --test` on one of these.

//     the path it named, rather than the generic "no clone". A skip whose
//     reason does not distinguish "you have no clone" from "you told me the
//     wrong place" is a skip that reads as normal on a CI leg that is broken.
//   · The no-clone arm becomes DRIVABLE on a machine that has a clone —
//     `TOWN_CLONE=/no/such/place` reaches it. Without that, the skip branches
//     every suite below now depends on could not be exercised anywhere they
//     were written, and a guard nothing can drive is a guard nobody checked.
