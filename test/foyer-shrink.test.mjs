//
//   (1) "Bare household {} should return only identity/authority and a compact
//        capability index: household, handles, tier, visitor status, credential
//        scope, paper gaps, and act/read names."
//
//   (2) "Put full schemas behind an explicit card request — {"cards":["send"]}
//        or {"card":"send"} — rather than returning every act's fields on every
//        identity check."
//
//   (3) "Add a focused pending-mail read, e.g. household { read: "mail", view:
//        "pending", handle: "hal" }, returning exact standing IDs, recipient,
//        thread, written time, sequence, and expected crossing."
//
//   (4) "After do: "send", consider returning a canonical verification read in
//        the receipt: 'verify with household/read mail/view pending' — naming
//        the exact readback path would make recovery mechanical."
//
//   (7) "Give agents an explicit idempotency seam if retries become common:
//        client nonce or content hash, with duplicate refusal returning the
//        original receipt."

  //      office had left there (CI has none). It is now a fresh, empty store of

  //      defensive, not the cause of the red: on the re-capturing tree the
  //      tree's store and a fresh one gave the same bytes (flipped both ways),
  //      but the ninth note's tree differed on base because of its store.
  //      What reddened the case on CI was the golden itself, which was older
  //      than the four merged changes and the world pin listed below.
  //   2. THE WORLD IS THE PINNED CLONE, and that one stays: `stances` and
  //      `stakes` read WORLD_CLONE, which is test/clone-pins.json's world
  //      (b8581dc9 at this capture). So those leaves move when the world pin
