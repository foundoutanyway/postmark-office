// funding.test.mjs — the funding seam at the door (2026-08-21).
//
// The ledger rows below are the LANDED grammar (tools/stamp-mint.mjs § THE
// FUNDING SEAM, seam/ledger-legs-aligned @ 3668881b), not a paraphrase of it:
// tight `pot:` and `epoch:`, loose `rail: `/`usd: `/`from: `/`ref: `/`for: `,
// whole dollars, a keeping burn that IS the escrow movement, and two arrow-free
// rows (holo to the payers, the keeping mint home to the stakers) that carry no
// arrow precisely so no fold that moves money can ever see them.
//
// The fixture is one coherent epoch close on the town's own pot, in the town's
// canonical close-block order (pot-return, keeping-burn, keeping mint, holo),
// so the numbers mean something: the $150 posted need is fully met, wright's 4
// burns whole at funded_fraction 1, σ=0.5 → 2 minted for keeping home to wright
// HIMSELF (not to the pot's beneficiary), and floor((1−σ)·4 · 100/150) = 1 holo
// to the $100 payer, 0 to the $50 payer — and a row for BOTH, because the close
// writes one per receipt whether it mints anything or not.
//
// THE FOUNDER'S RULING, 2026-08-26. The 2026-08-24 proposal for a second money
// row was ideation and never shipped. holo stays, there is no replacement noun,
// and `pot-receipt` remains the only money row. What the proposed row used to
// carry — the mark that a receipt's ref had been consumed — now rides the holo
// row, which is why its count is `(\d+)` and 0 is lawful.
//
// AMENDED 2026-09-17 — THE FOUNDER'S RULING, verbatim: "non-spendable is
// repealed; the stamps are like any other, but are holo to signify the special
// source." And: "I'm good to let funding minted stamps contribute to the max
// stamps you can get from another fund. it compounds by design." Holo is fresh
// mint to a giver, liquid like any stamp; the word names its source and its ink.
//
// WHAT THAT DOES TO THIS FILE, and it is worth stating because it is not what
// the sweep's brief expected: the office gained NO holo arm, because the office
// holds no balance fold. `balance` / `mint_count` / `staked` come off the
// `stamps` table, which src/hydrate.mjs writes from the TOWN's own foldBalances
// / foldMintCount / foldStaked, imported live from the checkout; both stake
// clips take their balance from the town's ballotState. So the tense numbers
// change by DERIVATION when the town's folds credit holo by kind
// (postmark-town/postmark #2811), and the fixtures below seed the `stamps` table
// the way that amended fold will write it. The one arithmetic the office really
// owned — D1's ownership sum — DID have to change: it added holo to a
// mint_count that now already contains it.
//
// The laws these tests pin:
//   - holo is LIQUID: it is inside minted and liquid, inside assets, and the
//     caption is exact (was: holo is soulbound and never sums into assets)
//   - and it is counted ONCE — the ownership read does not add a holo that is
//     already inside the town's mint_count
//   - a zero-holo household reads a WELL-FORMED empty section, not an absence
//   - a pot's contributor roll carries every holo row on it, joined to the
//     pot-receipt that row's `ref:` names
//   - a keeping burn drains the escrow it burned — a matched stake does not
//     sit in the pot forever looking like support that will come back
//   - a row written in the grammar the office GUESSED before the town landed
//     its own is surfaced invalid by name, never rendered as good
//   - R12's σ leg IS mint, source-tagged, with no liquid coin — so it is inside
//     the ownership read and outside every tense
//   - D1's ownership is a READ, not a fifth tense, and shows its own parts
//   - the reserved `treasury` pot takes direct-to-town receipts only, and they
//     mint nothing — and are still settled, with a holo row of 0
//   - A ZERO-HOLO RECEIPT IS STILL SETTLED. Without that, every grant, treasury
//     dollar, outside payment, ρ-capped household and sole staker would be
//     re-counted and re-minted at every future close
