//   node --test test/gangway-drain.test.mjs
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE HOLDS SHUT, in the town's own words. The Registrar's
// audit-era instruments name it as data rather than prose so that
// `node tools/registrar-audit.mjs seams` prints it —
// `GANGWAY_IN_THE_AUDIT_ERA.audit_era_gap`, verbatim:
//
//   "THE AUDIT-ERA DRAIN DOES NOT READ IT. src/town-drain.mjs § planTownDrain
//    (office repo) sorts every pending row into settle/waiting/skipped and
//    never opens HARBOR/GANGWAY.md — so with TOWN_SINGLE_LOG on, a frozen
//    gangway would not stop a crossing from settling rows. The breaker is
//    wired to the lane the pivot retires and not to the lane that replaces it."
//
// And the falsifier it asked for, `OFFICE_SEAM.gangway.falsifier`, verbatim:
//
//   "A crossing with `state: frozen` settles zero rows and advances no cursor;
//    the same crossing with `state: open` settles them. Flip both directions."
//
// THE CURSOR IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS, and it is the half the seam note did not
// know it was asking for. Filing a row under `waiting` is a line in a REPORT;
// runTownDrain advanced the cursor to the last PENDING row whatever pile it
// landed in, so a held join would have been reported as waiting and then walked
// past forever. G4 is that falsifier, and it fails on the reporting half alone.
