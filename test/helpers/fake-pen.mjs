// fake-pen.mjs — a Postgres stand-in for the pen, small enough to read.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is not a mock of the pen. The mark lane's whole
// question is "did the act and its claim land on ONE client inside ONE
// transaction, in the order the door made them?" — and that question cannot be
// asked of a stub that swallows statements. It needs a store that actually
// holds rows and a transaction that can actually roll back, or an assertion
// about atomicity is an assertion about nothing.
//
// It also cannot be asked of the real store from a laptop. `world2-pen.mjs`
// reaches Postgres exactly one way — `const { default: pg } = await
// import("pg")` inside `pool()` — so `module.registerHooks` (node:module,
// synchronous, no CLI flag) resolves that ONE specifier to this file. Nothing
// in `src/` learns it is being tested: no injected pool, no test-only export,
// no seam in the pen that production has to carry. That is the point — a seam
// added for a test is a seam the pen would have to keep honest forever.
//
// WHAT IT MODELS, deliberately narrow: only the statements the mark lane's two
// halves issue (world2-pen § insertAct, world2-claims § claimTxFromJournal),
// dispatched by regex on the statement text rather than parsed. A statement it
// does not recognize THROWS by name — a silent `{rows:[]}` for an unrecognized
// statement is how a fake starts lying, and a test that passes against a lie is
// worse than no test. Extend it when the lane grows a statement; do not soften
// the throw.
//
// WHAT IT RECORDS: `log` is every statement in the order it was issued, tagged
// with the client that issued it. That is the whole apparatus for "one client,
// one transaction": if the act and the claim carry two different client ids, or
// a COMMIT sits between them, the assertion sees it.
