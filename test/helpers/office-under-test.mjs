// office-under-test.mjs — the town index a test's office reads: the store.
//
// The office reads its town index from the store (POS-268; office.db is gone,
// POS-656). So a test that boots an office (or calls its doors in-process)
// gives it a store seeded from the fixture town the test states
// (test/fixture.mjs § fixtureTown), the way the ingest would have written it.
// The rows stay the test's one statement of the town; this helper turns them
// into the store.
//
//   const town = fixtureTown();               // then put / drop / setMeta
//   const ix = await indexStore(town);        // in before()
//   spawn(node, [server.mjs, ...], { env: { ...process.env, ...ix.env } });
//   await ix.reseed();                        // after the test changed the rows
//   await ix.stop();                          // in after()
//
// A file that cannot start its store FAILS with embedded-store.mjs § NO_STORE.
