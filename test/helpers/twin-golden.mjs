// twin-golden.mjs — the office.db twins' answers, frozen (POS-656).
//
// Until POS-656 these suites held each store reader, and each door switched to
// the store, equal to its office.db twin asked alike over one fixture town.
// office.db is gone, so the twins' answers were recorded once, in the last tree
// that had both (train/2026-w43 at 941a0ed40; the PR names the run), over the
// same fixture rows, and the suites hold the store to that record:
// test/golden/office-db-twins/<suite>.json, each label mapped to the twin's
// answer as the suite compared it (a door's status and bytes, or a reader's
// JSON). A label the record lacks fails by name, so a renamed ask cannot pass
// quietly against nothing.
//
// TWIN_GOLDEN_RECORD=<dir> is how the record was made: the base tree's suites,
// patched to call `record` with each twin answer, wrote <dir>/<suite>.json.
// No suite in this tree records.

 * into a letter id, reads "<today>". JSON carried as text (an MCP result's
 * content) is opened, so its clock goes too. A failed command's own words
 * (git's, inside an "unreadable" note, with the test's temp path in them) and a
 * checkout's line endings differ by machine and by run: the first reads
 * "(<a command failed>)", CRLF reads LF, and a hung pane's file size (the
 * checkout's bytes) is left out. Every other byte stays, key order included.
