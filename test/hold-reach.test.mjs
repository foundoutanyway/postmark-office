// hold-reach.test.mjs — THE REACH OF A HOLD (the-town/the-reach, world PR #21).
//
// The founder's ruling, 2026-09-07: "taking something should require moving into
// its coords extent (just like enter/exit), and you should be able to drop
// something right where you stand."
//
// EVERY TEST HERE IS A WALK OR A CLAUSE, and the walks come first because they
// are what the law was ruled from. Walks #10, #11 and #12 of
// `docs/2026-09-07/resident-walk.md` are reproduced on fixtures with the
// distances the walk actually measured — 379 m for the give, 536 m for the top
// at the archway — so a reader can see the sentence that was false and the
// answer that is now true, side by side and in the resident's own numbers.
//
// The fixtures are hand-built rows and hand-built marks, injected. That is the
// discipline `declareHolding` set for itself and the reason it is testable at
// all: the adjudication is what is under test, never the world engine, the
// walk ledger or the clone.
