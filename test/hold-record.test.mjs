// hold-record.test.mjs — the hold lane's record kept and moved by its delta
// (src/hold-record.mjs; LOGOS v2 lane O2, review-610 S5 and F1).
//
// "Compute only the delta": the keeper folds the history once into a base and
// applies each change as the acts above its cutoff. Proven here with injected
// readers (the keeping itself) and, on the embedded store, the high-water read's
// plan (EXPLAIN: by the class index, no scan of acts).
