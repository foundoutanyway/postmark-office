// Repair 4, and it is this lane's own lesson finished rather than learned
// again. On its first flip run the lane found F6: deleting the one line that
// puts hold events on the `since:` shelf reddened NOTHING, because five tests
// watched the deriver and none watched the wiring. It fixed that one site and
// did not carry the method to the other three. The reviewer ran the deletions
// and all three were silent:
//
//   · `groundWithinReach`            — no test names it at all
//   · apex `readHoldEffects` → `happenedBlock` — every reference in the suite
//                                      is the pure deriver or hand-injected events
//   · `thingStandsBlock` on `world_investigate` — never driven
//
// Each probe below drives the REAL function against a temp store, in the shape
// of this lane's two door probes and `test/arena.test.mjs`'s hold-door leg.
// Delete the call site each names and one of these reds.
