// holder-nesting.test.mjs — plumb-nest-guard: counts confer up, and the loop
// check walks the whole way (Darko, 2026-10-17 23:29: "counts confer up"; and
// 2026-10-18 12:17, POS-679: any number of holders carried, nesting free;
// LOGOS/classes.md § The transfer edge).
//
//   1. a second and a third holder land in your hands, by a take and by a
//      pot-luck draw that hands the holder over whole; the 24 slots still bind;
//      a holders dial, if a ruling ever sets one, still binds (and a make of a
//      holder kind stays refused);
//   2. a holder counts 1 plus everything it holds toward the room of what holds
//      it: a bag of 30 into a chest of 120 takes 31;
//   3. a give into a pouch in a bag in a chest checks all three rooms;
//   4. a holder far below the thing it would go into is still refused;
//   5. a loop already in the rows ends every walk and the give is refused.
//
// Each test is a falsifier: it fails on train/2026-w43 @ dd226dbd and passes
// with src/holder-tree.mjs and its callers, except where a line says it was
// already so. The kind door (`callKinds`, src/world-kinds.mjs) with every
// collaborator injected over an in-memory record, as kind-door.test.mjs drives
// it. The tree's helpers are read through a namespace import, so on the old code
// they are absent and the test fails rather than the file failing to load.
