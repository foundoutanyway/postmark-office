// ONE HOUSEHOLD, ONE KEY, AT ADMISSION (#3429) — every road writes the house's
// key line with the pin, in the same commit, through src/house-key.mjs.
//
// The instance: a pen join into tonzhub (already on `hh:tonzhub`) wrote
// mireo-silt's pin at admission, and the `registry:` line that would have
// keyed them to the house was left to a drain that never sees a pen join. The
// house minted under two keys until a hand repair. These legs run the real
// roads (`bindUnderLock`, `settleUnderLock`, `runTownDrain`) against the town's
// own engine, the town's own predicate (tools/household-keys.mjs) and the
// town's own stamp-verify as the oracle, never a reimplementation. The
// declaration road is pinned in pen-transaction.test.mjs (P16), where its exec
// already runs.
//
// THE CAVEAT Wright measured (10-05): a line dated D re-keys every mint the
// ledger already holds on D. The legs below prove the dating rule both ways:
// a housemate who minted earlier the same day under the house's one `gh:` key
// re-keys with the replay still green, and a re-key that would change what
// today minted refuses, writes nothing, and lands the next day.
