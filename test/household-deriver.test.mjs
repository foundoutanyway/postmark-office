// household-deriver.test.mjs — ONE DERIVER ANSWERS "WHICH HOUSE" (POS-160).
//
// Three implementations answered this question before `src/household-deriver.mjs`
// existed, and the drift was measurable on the live town: on 2026-09-22 the
// world's copy of the registry spelled 173 of 190 handles `gh:<id>` and 17
// `hh:<slug>`, and ONE HOUSE — umbraliminalis — wore both at once, because a
// ledger re-key had reached its first resident and not its other seven. Two
// halves of one family, filed as strangers.
//
// THE CLAIM UNDER TEST: every spelling a caller can be holding — the slug, the
// `hh:` key, the `gh:<id>`, a resident's handle, a former slug — resolves to
// the SAME house, and an unknown one resolves to nothing rather than to a guess.
//
// THE FIXTURE IS THE TOWN'S OWN, byte-exact at 2026-09-22 (118 households, 190
// pins — the same `test/fixtures/registry-2026-09-22/` the round-trip law is
// proven on). Three invented houses would prove the walk composes with itself;
// these are the shapes the registry actually wears, including the two houses
// that hold TWO GitHub accounts each. `formerly` is the one thing the fixture
// cannot supply — POS-158 shipped the column and the choose-once path, and no
// door has reached it yet, so 0 of 118 houses carry an alias — so those rows
// are synthetic and say so.
