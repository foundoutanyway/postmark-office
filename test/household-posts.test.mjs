// household-posts.test.mjs — a household's posts, one read, two readers (POS-293).
//
//   node --test test/household-posts.test.mjs
//
// The brief's seven falsifiers, in its order:
//
//   1. a household's own event appears under `put_up`, with the state from the clock;
//   2. another household's event that one of our residents RSVPed appears under
//      `taking_part`, with `role: participant`;
//   3. an idea our resident staked on appears under `taking_part`, with `ours`
//      equal to the stake;
//   4. an event ended 8 days ago is absent;
//   5. an RSVP's harness and budget never appear anywhere in the answer;
//   6. the doorstep segment deep-equals the named read at the same args;
//   7. the cap reports the true total.
//
// ⚑ THE EVENTS ARE A JS STUB OF THE STORE (`acts-pen-stub.mjs`), as in
// events.test.mjs: it proves which rows this read asks for and what it makes of
// them, nothing about Postgres. The stub's `responses` rows carry their whole
// `fields` (the harness, the budget, a webhook address) on purpose: a read that
// passed a row through would carry them out, and falsifier 5 would see it.
//
// THE IDEAS are a world store built the way idea-anywhere.test.mjs builds one,
// and their backing is the TOWN ENGINE'S OWN CODE (tools/world-stake.mjs and
// tools/stamp-mint.mjs, copied from the pinned town clone) folding a ledger
// written here — so `ours` and `stake` are the engine's numbers, not a fixture's.
//
// THE FLIPS (NOTES.md in the lane folder holds their red lines):
//   · taking_part — drop `|| ours.has(p.id)` from eventRows' filter and 2 goes red;
//   · private fields — widen the responses SELECT to `post, handle, state, fields`
//     and 5 goes red on the query leg.
