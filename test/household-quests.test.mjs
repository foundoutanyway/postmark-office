// household-quests.test.mjs — `household { read: "quests" }` answers for the
// resident who was NAMED.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS PINS, from a resident's seat (docs/2026-09-06/resident-walk.md,
// 17:53 EDT, item 1): a seven-resident household asked
//
//     household { read: "quests", handle: "wright" }
//
// and was answered `"of": "architect"` — Reach out 0/5, counted [] — while
// `town { read: "quests", args: { handle: "wright" } }` answered 1/5,
// counted ["errant"] for the same handle in the same minute. The board took the
// key's alphabetically first resident whatever it was asked. Every
// multi-resident household in town read someone else's progress under its own
// name, and no single-resident household could ever have seen it.
//
