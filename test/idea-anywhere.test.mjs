// idea-anywhere.test.mjs — AN IDEA MAY STAND ANYWHERE, and the Tank reads by
// instance rather than by geometry.   node --test test/idea-anywhere.test.mjs
//
// ── THE LAW, quoted, not paraphrased ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The founder, 2026-09-01 morning, ruling on an idea planted in the Garrison —
// feature, not bug:
//
//   "class says what a mark is; the Think Tank is where ideas are READ, not a
//    container that makes them ideas."
//
// and, ten minutes later, the half that makes the row shape matter:
//
//   "Ideas can be predicates."
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The repealed reading joined `contains` from the tank's ground, so an idea its
// author stood anywhere else was not merely filed oddly — it was invisible to
// `town read: "ideas"`, to the doorstep's first-idea row, and to the crossing
// sweep that MINTS 5✦ for it. Reproduced on a store hydrated from world main
// fdca66cc, before anything was changed: an idea standing in the Protected
// Grove came back in 0 of 6 tank rows and drew 0 of 1 planned mints. That is
// the whole reason the join moved, so the money is falsified here rather than
// only in a report.
//
// ── WHY THE FIXTURE LOOKS LIKE THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The store keys a class mark as `subkind: 'class'` and a predicated mark as
// `subkind: 'predicated'`, with `kind` reading 'mark' for both — the mark FILE's
// frontmatter says otherwise, so a fixture written from the record's text
// falsifies nothing. And the declaration must stand IN THE KEEPING WORKS
// (`props.in_works`), because that is half of CLASS_ROSTER_GATE_SQL. Every
// shape below was read off a store hydrated from world main before it was
// typed; `civic-asks.test.mjs § tankWith` carries the same note for the same
// reason.
