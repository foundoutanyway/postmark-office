//
// Wright's seam review of #463, notes 1–4: with the switch on, the town tool's
// description and the town_post card still taught the mark road (the Tank cell,
// the 1✦ escrow) before saying an idea is a post. The office reads its cards at
// load, so each state is read in its own child process.
//
//   1. ON: the town tool, the town_post card and the post act's card teach the
//      idea POST, and none of them teaches the mark road's escrow for an idea;
//   2. OFF: every one of them teaches the mark road, as before, and none says
//      an idea is a post;
//   3. ON or OFF: the idea acts' flat verbs are delisted (born behind the apex),
//      and the town tool's do: enum carries them only when on;
//   4. the award card states the label rule exactly as the ledger keeps it, and
//      the award's refusal to a hand who is not an award's names who awards;
//   5. OFF is pinned: the town's whole card surface (the town tool and its
//      schema, the bare read with its register law, every act's card, the
//      town flat verbs, the listed names) is byte-identical to
//      test/fixtures/town-cards-off.json: the surface the w42 train serves
//      with the class shut (proved equal to a4c38821's src, #464 merged, and so
//      to #463's; before #463 only read_posts differs, which takes class idea
//      because the reads are not switched).
//      A lane that changes a town card on purpose rewrites the fixture with
//      UPDATE_TOWN_CARDS=1 node --test test/idea-cards.test.mjs, and the diff
//      shows in its review.
//
