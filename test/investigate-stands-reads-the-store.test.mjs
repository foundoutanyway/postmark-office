// investigate-stands-reads-the-store.test.mjs — POS-162.
//
// `GET /world/investigate` for a mark that EXISTS carries a `stands` block:
// where a held thing actually is, in the law's own three sources. It used to
// open `dynamic.db` read-only for both halves — the `attachments` table and the
// holding-class `journal`. It reads `acts` now, unconditionally, and the sqlite
// read is gone rather than layered under.
//
// ── WHY IT HAD TO MOVE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The sqlite journal TRUNCATES at every drain (world-drain.mjs § the cursor), so
// a set-down older than the cursor was simply not on the record this door could
// read — and the-town/the-reach says that position "is canon at the next fold
// like any move, never a fall-back to the last place the thing was folded".
// `acts` is never truncated. Same shape as POS-152's act reader, one door over.
//
// ── THE DOOR IS THE SUBJECT, NOT THE DERIVATION ─────────────────────────────
//
// `whereThingStands` is pure and already has its own tests on hand-built rows
// (hold-reach, hold-wirings). Those cannot see the law not being CALLED, and
// they stayed green through every shape of this change. So every case here goes
// through `worldInvestigate` — the real door, on a REAL canon mark, because the
// door folds canon out of WORLD_CLONE and a fixture id would bounce before the
// block was ever reached.
//
// ── THE FLIP, run 2026-09-21 against this branch ────────────────────────────
//
// In `src/world.mjs § thingStandsBlock`, put the sqlite read back — replace
//
//     const [{ standsRowsFromStore }, hold] = await Promise.all([
//       import("./world2-guards.mjs"), import("./world-hold.mjs"),
//     ]);
//     const rows = await standsRowsFromStore(id);
//     if (!rows) return null;
//     const { attachments, journal } = rows;
//
// with the 1.0 road —
//
//     const [{ openDynamicReadOnly }, { readAttachments }, { readJournal }, hold] =
//       await Promise.all([ import("./dynamic-store.mjs"), import("./dynamic-entities.mjs"),

//     if (!dyn) return null;
//     const attachments = readAttachments(dyn);
//     const journal = readJournal(dyn, { cls: "holding" });
//
// — and the store legs red. `flip.sh` beside this lane's paperwork runs it and
// asserts its own match count.
