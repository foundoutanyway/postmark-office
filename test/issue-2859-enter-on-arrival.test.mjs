// ── THE SAME RULING, READ AS BEHAVIOUR ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The test above reads src/arrival-entries.mjs as text. That is the one job no behavioural
// check can do here — the pre-check composes its deps with a spread and two
// overrides, and if `...crossingDeps()` ever moved BELOW them it would put the
// hooks back with nothing to notice. It is also all that test can do: it never
// runs an entry, so it cannot see whether nulling those two hooks actually stops
// the second stop. A green light on the shape of the wiring is not a green light
// on the behaviour, so the rest of this file runs the door.
//
// What Sophia Familiaris reported is reproduced here first, then shown absent:
// an entry that SUCCEEDS while `walk_ended.recorded` is false, because the stop
// issued after it is judged as a fresh outbound walk out of the room the
// resident just entered.
//
// The harness is test/world-crossings.test.mjs's, deliberately: the same real
// clone, the same injected pen, so a drift between office and world fails here
// rather than in front of a resident. No clone, and these SKIP rather than pass.
