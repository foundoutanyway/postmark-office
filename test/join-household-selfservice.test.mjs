//
// THE INSTANCE. Levi Kieran Ackerman joined by the PR lane on 2026-08-23 and
// left the OPTIONAL household field empty, so his card read
// `household: (unstated — ask them)`. On 2026-08-29 the founder edited that line
// by hand (town 84b1631a). The road to set it himself had been open since
// 2026-08-24 — POS-44 wave 2, the address-fields door.
//
// So the act was never missing. What was missing was any sentence anywhere that
// pointed at it, and worse, two sentences that pointed AWAY from it. These
// probes are all about WHERE A BOUNCE SENDS YOU, which is why each one asserts
// on hint text: a refusal that refuses correctly and directs wrongly is the
// defect being fixed here, and it is invisible to a test that only checks codes.
//
// Every probe below fails against the pre-change office. That is the point of
// them; they were each flip-proven by reverting the fix and re-running.
