// keep-world-hydrate.test.mjs — the keeping tick writes the world graph
// snapshot, and only that (POS-270 lane W; world.db retired in 3b), and a miss
// never fails it. Moved off the retired rehydrate unit (POS-268 part 5b).
//
// deploy/office-world-hydrate.sh runs ONE world hydration with ONE output,
// --to-store, connecting as the law pen through deploy/world2-lib.sh §
// w2_pgenv. What is under test is the shell's control flow around it:
//
//   0   written                 → said plainly
//   1   refused / store missed  → the office keeps the snapshot it has, said loudly
//   no credentials              → no hydration at all, said loudly
//
// and in every case no world.db is written and the script exits 0: the keeping
// tick runs it before the panes, and a world that could not hydrate must never
// stop them.
//
// The SHIPPED script and the SHIPPED lib run against a stubbed hydrator. Runs
// under `dash` where it exists (the box's /bin/sh), else `sh`; where neither is
// a real shell, or there is no bash for the lib, the file SKIPS rather than
// passes. The rehydrate's version of this file also stubbed flock and curl for
// the lock and the door receipt; this script has neither, both went with
// office.db.
