// kind-door-on-the-pen.test.mjs — LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O2: the kind door on a
// real store. The acts are written by the real pen (appendActFlipped) and read
// back from Postgres; the holder's room is judged again under its own lock in
// the write's transaction (chest-lock.mjs § chestRoomGuard), counting kinds; a
// pot-luck take is replayed from the act the store holds; and leave-mark into
// yourself runs the flat tool's own implementation (leaveMarkViaOffice) with
// the office's live collaborators.
