// kind-door.test.mjs — LOGOS v2 part 2, lane O2: marks made into a holder, and
// taken and given by kind, driven through the kind door with an in-memory record.
//
// `callKinds` (src/world-kinds.mjs) with every collaborator injected, over a law
// snapshot in W1's shape (the class tree as ruled 2026-10-16, holder → capacity
// → min/max and holder → open as nested property nodes; the Halloween Candy
// Bowl's afforded `refill`). The real pen, reach and queue are proven by their
// own suites; these prove the adjudication. Each test names the falsifier it is
// (O2's list, sent to the lead 2026-10-17, with the lead's three settlements:
// capacity refuses whole and says the room; pot luck is derived from the act;
// portable is sovereign, default true).
