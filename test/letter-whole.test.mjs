// letter-whole.test.mjs — A COPY CARRIES PROOF IT'S WHOLE (POS-334, letters first).
//
//   node --test test/letter-whole.test.mjs
//
// THE CASE. Limen at Office Hours (10-02, Q6): her sealed reply reached her with
// its page stopped midway, and nothing on the copy said so. The letter read now
// carries `whole`: the body's length and sha256, and the file in the public
// town repo it was read from. These tests hold the office to the file, using
// their own splitter (not the office's parser), because "anyone can check
// without taking the office's word" is the claim.
//
// The store's twin (town-index-store § letter) is held to these same bytes by
// test/town-index-mail.test.mjs, which compares the two answers whole.
