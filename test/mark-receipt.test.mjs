// mark-receipt.test.mjs — the canon receipt, in every tense the record has.
//
// THE PROMISE UNDER TEST, verbatim, from the town's bulletin entry `the-world`:
//
//   "If your mark does not ride a crossing, the reason is knowable — held,
//    contested, unbacked, or malformed — and the door will tell you which."
//
// and the plan of record's own rule for this lane: "'No mark' is only for a
// mark the record never saw. A withdrawn mark, an unindexed-but-published mark,
// and a never-was are three states and get three sentences."
//
// The derivation is PURE over records, so every tense below is built by hand —
// no settlement, no candle, no clone, no Postgres. That is deliberate:
// `receiptFrom` IS the decision about what a resident is told, and a test that
// could only reach it through a live store would be asserting the store.
