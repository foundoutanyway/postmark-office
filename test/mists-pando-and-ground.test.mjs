// mists-pando-and-ground.test.mjs — the Mists' other roads (POS-468 B).
//
// Pando Peak keeps its own air: a clearing round all
// its ground, the Post Office's landing with it, so the ride is the one link
// between Pando and the map. Proved here with the office's own ride code (its
// timetable and set-down points) and the walk door's own road reading:
//   ride in → set down in clear ground; walk inside Pando → allowed (going
//   home, for the household whose parcel is there); ride out → set down in
//   town; walk out of Pando → refused at the wall.
// And the two guards: no mark placed or moved onto ground
// behind the wall, and no portal ground that sets anyone down there.
