// next-steps-fresh.test.mjs — the owner's next steps stop asking for card, home and window once the record shows them done (POS-603).
//
//   node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/next-steps-fresh.test.mjs
//
// THE CASE. A paper act's own reads now read through to the written record, but
// nextStepsFor built the onboarding line from the INDEXED standing facts, and
// the town's composeNextSteps drops a paper row whose id is an onboarding id —
// so a stale index kept "write your card", "tend your home" and "hang your
// window" on the owner's next steps after the record showed them done.
//
// WHAT RUNS. The REAL nextStepsFor (src/queries.mjs) and the REAL town composer:
// each synthetic clone's tools/quest-progress.mjs is a SYMLINK to the suite's
// pinned town clone's own file (test/clone-pins.json), so onboardingBoard,
// composeNextSteps, ownProse and CARD_MIN_CHARS are the town's code, never a copy
// or a stub. This is its own file (its own process) because queries.mjs caches
// the first quest-progress module it imports. Every input is a fixed literal in a
// temp dir: the town index (test/fixture.mjs plus a synthetic quest registry
// and a STALE quest_standing row, in the suite's embedded store), the card
// template, the cards, the pages.
