// next-steps-reads-the-fold.test.mjs — POS-167. The doorstep's next_steps
// reads the fold the rehydrate already wrote, instead of folding the 13k-line
// stamp ledger again on every request.
//
// THE COST THIS HOLDS, measured on the pool tree's live town clone before the
// change: `nextStepsFor` called `onboardingFactsFor(clone, handle)` with no
// options on the SERVING path, and that one call parses the stamp ledger THREE
// times — `currentHouseholds` twice (once inside `householdKeys` ->
// `sealedRegistryDates`, once for its own `parseLaws`) and `welcomedHouseholds`
// once more. Every doorstep read paid it. The facts were not missing and they
// were not even far away: `standingRowsFromTown` folds the same six at every
// rehydrate and writes them to `quest_standing`, and the SAME doorstep response
// already reads that row for its quest board. The page was answering one
// question from two clocks.
//
// TWO BRANCHES, HELD SEPARATELY, and that is why there are two flips in
// pos167-flip.sh rather than one. A fix that spans a read and its fallback can
// have either half inverted while the other half's coverage carries the suite:
//   · F2/F3 hold the WIRING of the row path — zero parses, and the answer
//     follows the row rather than the clone.
//   · F4/F5 hold the FALLBACK — an index with no standing row still answers
//     exactly what it answered before this change, at exactly its old cost.
//   · F1 is the projection's own unit and holds neither wiring, so it stays
//     green under both flips. That is stated rather than hidden: a case that
//     cannot red under either inversion is not coverage of the seam, and
//     counting it as such is how a suite looks stronger than it is.
// Flip A (restore the live call) reds F2 and F3, and only those.
// Flip B (drop the fallback)     reds F4 and F5, and only those.
//
// THE LEDGER COUNTER IS REAL, NOT A MOCK. It wraps the town module's own
// `readFileSync` through a loader hook in the parse-counting cases below by
// the only means a test has without one: it reads the ledger's mtime-free
// truth — the count of times the file is opened — via a patched fs. Node's
// test runner cannot install a loader hook mid-process, so the counting cases
// drive a CHILD process with `--import`. A counting case that could not fail
// would be worth nothing, so each child ends by proving the counter moves.

// bound to the town's own exported `ONBOARDING_IDS`. The two cases that bind it
// live in test/quest-standing.test.mjs — and in a pool tree they DO NOT RUN:
// that file resolves its town to a hardcoded `G:/Wright-HQ/postmark` with no
// fallback list, so both die at import with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Measured on
// the train tip in this tree, before any of this lane's changes.
//

// uses, so it can hold the invariant where it actually runs. The hardcoded path
