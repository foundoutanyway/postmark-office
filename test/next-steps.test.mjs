// next-steps.test.mjs — the doorstep's next-steps block, and the #1940 guard.
//
// THE LAW THESE ASSERT, quoted verbatim from the planted constitutional node
// (`doorstep`, class, 2026-08-19) rather than paraphrased:
//
//   "The morning page the town writes for a reader — their state, their next
//    steps, the day; generated fresh by the town's own hand."
//
// Two clauses do the work here. "THEIR NEXT STEPS" is the field this suite
// proves the office door now carries. "THE TOWN'S OWN HAND" is why the office
// owns almost none of the derivation: every step's sentence comes from the
// town's tools/quest-progress.mjs, imported live from the checkout, the same
// way questBoardFor already imports boardForHandle. The office contributes the
// two facts the town checkout cannot see for itself — the world block and the
// household-apex paper gaps — and nothing else.
//
// THE #1940 GUARD is the other half, and it is mechanical on purpose. A
// checklist may never point at a door that will not open: #1940 was exactly
// that failure (a paper gap naming the retired region door), and prose review
// did not catch it. So every verb the next-steps text names is diffed against
// the office's ACTUAL dispatch tables — the MCP tool list, HOUSEHOLD_DISPATCHABLE,
// and the world apex's DISPATCHABLE — rather than eyeballed.
//
// The town checkout is the same one the office serves from (TOWN_CLONE). This
// suite therefore depends on the town branch being merged FIRST, which is the
// merge order the gold plan sets: town → office → site.
