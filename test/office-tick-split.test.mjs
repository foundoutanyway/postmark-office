// office-tick-split.test.mjs — the office tick, split in two (POS-268, 2026-09-27),
// and the rehydrate half retired (POS-268 part 5b, 2026-10-08).
//
// The rehydrate unit used to run everything the office does on a clock: pull
// the clones, catch the mint up, write the settlements row, publish the panes,
// AND rebuild office.db + world.db. The split moved the keeping work to its own
// unit; part 5b deleted the rehydrate. office.db is no longer built anywhere,
// and the world hydration, the one rehydrate step something still reads, runs
// in the keeping tick.
//
// ⚑ TEXT PINS, like welcome-pass.test.mjs and settlements-backfill.test.mjs:
// nothing in a unit test can run a systemd unit, and what these hold is which
// file carries which line.
