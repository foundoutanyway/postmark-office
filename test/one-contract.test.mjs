// one-contract.test.mjs — POS-70 box 1 (postmark#2754): EVERY ACT THROUGH BOTH
// DOORS, the same input, the same outcome, the same answer shape.
//
// The issue's own sentence is the design of this file: "A test drives every
// act through both doors with the same input and asserts the same outcome and
// the same answer shape; the first run of that test is the inventory of
// today's drift." So this file was written FIRST and run at the train tip
// (6b86776) before any fix; its reds at that tip are the measured half of the
// inventory in the PR body, one test name per row.
//
// TWO OFFICES, NOT ONE. A write through the first door changes the clone the
// second door would write to — the same letter twice is a 409 on the id, the
// same home twice is `unchanged` — so "the same input" through one office
// would compare a first act with a second one. Each door gets its own office
// on its own identical fixture clone, and the comparison is of two FIRST acts:
// the receipt, and the bytes each act left in its town.
//
// THE MCP DOOR MEANS THE LISTED ONE — the `household` / `town` apex verbs a
// connector holds. The flat tools are delisted (still answering for cached
// clients); the contract's sentence is the apex's. The plain API means the
// routes CONTRACT.md teaches: POST /letters, the PATCH paper doors, the world
// routes, and so on.
//
// WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHAT IS NOT. The apex wraps the implementation's
// receipt as `result` beside its card; the REST route answers that receipt
// bare. Parity is REST body ≡ apex `result`. Stripped from both, and named:
// `commit` (a sha — two clones, two commits, the same content) and
// `next_crossing` (minutes-until, read off the wall clock a few ms apart), and
// `prior_commit` on a window receipt (the sha of the pane it replaced — two
// clones' earlier legs, two shas) — and any sha a receipt QUOTES in a sentence
// is masked to <sha> for the same reason.
