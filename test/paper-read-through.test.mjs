// paper-read-through.test.mjs — a paper act's OWN readback at the household door shows what the pen wrote (POS-603).

//
// Found by neth (POS-603): a paper act (address, home, profile, window) answers
// done once the pen has committed the record, while the household door's own
// reads still answered from the office's older read index. The freshness ladder
// (src/paper-fresh.mjs) already composes the written record over the index; three
// household-door reads were never handed its context:
//
//   G1  household { read: "address" } (the store's branch already had it)
//   G2  household { read: "home" }
//   G3  the papers check (paperGapRows): "tend your HOME page" after the page
//       was tended — on the bare household read and read: "standing"
//
// WHAT RUNS. The real household apex (householdApex), the real paper doors
// (edit.mjs through paperDoor/penTransaction), the real freshFor and the real
// composed readers and hydration parsers, over:
//   · the suite's synthetic town index (test/fixture.mjs, fixed literals) in the
//     suite's embedded store (test/helpers/office-under-test.mjs § indexStore),
//     never an env-named database; it is never re-ingested here, so every pen
//     write leaves it STALE;
//   · a fresh synthetic town checkout per test (fixed literals, a temp dir, a
//     local bare origin for the push case), never a real clone.
// Injected, and only at the outside boundary: the world block (a fixed `null`)
// for the household reads; WORLD_CLONE pointed at an absent temp path, so the
// doorstep's own world read (which takes no injector) reports "unreadable" and
// never opens a world; the store index's pool (town-index-store.mjs §
// __setTownIndexPoolForTest) for the suspended, unreadable-standing and
// unreachable-store cases. Nothing here pushes beyond the temp origin, reads a
// real record, or calls an office endpoint.
