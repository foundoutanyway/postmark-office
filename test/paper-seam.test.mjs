// THE DEFECT THIS FILE HOLDS SHUT. Wave 2 wrote the town-log row in mcp.mjs's
// FLAT-TOOL switch — one call site beside one of the three ways a paper act
// reaches a door. The dev rehearsal (both flags on) found the other two:
//
//   PATCH /profile/wright        → pen commit 608cdf01, NO row
//   household do: "profile"      → dispatched_to update_profile, NO row
//   flat  update_profile         → row
//
// and the flats are the DELISTED path, so flag-on in production most real paper
// edits would never have reached the log at all — while `your_pending_edits`
// went on reporting a hot tense it could not see. A disclosure that lies by
// omission is worse than a missing one, because it reads as an answer.
//
// The repair is placement, not policy: the log moved to where the pen commit
// already lives, so a skin cannot forget it because a skin no longer has the
// option. These falsifiers are therefore mostly PER-SKIN — the bug was never in
// the logging rule, it was in how many places had to remember it.
