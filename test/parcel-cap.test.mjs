//
// Window 191 closed at 2026-09-15T17:45:46.821Z and LOCKED
// `mari/marigold-house-parcel`. The sweep, minutes later, refused it: the cap
// counts per credential household, Mari's resolves to the founder's, and that
// one held five. Measured on the box, the store has been carrying the parcel
// forward ever since — "CARRIED 1 canon-absent mark(s) from earlier window(s):
// mari/marigold-house-parcel" at windows 192, 193 and 194.
//
// ── WHAT THESE FALSIFIERS ARE FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The claim under test is not "there is a cap gate" — it is "it is THE SAME cap,
// by the same rule, read from the world and never copied". So the sharpest ones
// here are the two that would go red on a COPY that behaved identically today:
//
//   · the law object identity — the exceptions Map this gate consults must be
//     the very Map the world exports, not an equal one;
//   · the sentence — composed here from the world's three constants, and held
//     against the fold's OWN template literal, read out of the world's source.
//     `marks-fold.mjs` composes that sentence inline at BOTH of its cap sites
//     and exports no function for it, so this side is a third holder of one
//     sentence. This test is what makes that seam loud instead of silent.
