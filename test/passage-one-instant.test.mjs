// passage-one-instant.test.mjs — a passage's ferry and its iso come from ONE
// clock reading, taken after the door's reads (POS-618, 2026-10-14;
// src/world-crossings.mjs § passageInstant).
//
// The defect, measured on prod's live ledger: the enter and exit doors read the
// ferry first, then the world, the ledger and the standpoint, and the verb
// stamped the iso from a second reading. 114 of 2,084 live rows carry a ferry
// up to 59 s behind their own iso, and 3 of them land behind a row written
// before them. Here every read the door makes moves a fake clock on by 10 s, so
// a stamp taken before the reads, or a second reading, shows up as a mismatch.
// The fake clock starts far from the wall clock, so an iso stamped from a
// second, real reading cannot match it by accident.
//
// Also pinned: with no `deps.now`, the ferry is the ferry's clock, not the
// unix-half-day count (about 40,000 crossings ahead) the doors used to fall
// back to; and a `now` that names its own instant keeps it as the ferry while
// the iso is still the write. (enter_on_arrival used that to date rows ahead;
// since WLD-5 only its pre-check does, and the pre-check writes nothing.)
