// plain-reasons.test.mjs — a read that could not be read says a plain reason, never the error's
// own text (POS-657; RULED A, Darko 2026-10-16 20:04 EDT; src/fault-words.mjs § plainReason).
//
// Every disclosure keeps its "unknown, not zero" promise, and its parenthetical is one of four
// fixed reasons. What failed goes to the office's log. The legs below drive real readers with
// an error that carries the kind of text that must never reach an answer (a SQL fragment, a path
// on the box, pg's hint) and assert the answer carries none of it, and the log does.
// test/error-text-census.test.mjs counts the lines; this proves the behaviour.
