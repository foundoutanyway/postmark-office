// porch-lights.test.mjs — WLD-29, the pointer model: WHAT LEAVES THE OFFICE.
//
// The office keeps the town's household activity to itself (household-
// activity.mjs § what leaves). Out of it come three small things, and this
// file holds each to its shape:
//   · lightsAnswer — GET /world/lights: { crossing, window, lit: [keys] }, the
//     lit household keys only; a past crossing or an unread store says so with
//     `lit: null`, never an empty list;
//   · litOf — a shown house's `lit`, joined by the parcel's own
//     `declared_household` (the fold's key, `hh:<slug>` or `solo:<handle>`);
//   · houseFocus — "lit; last active crossing N; what lights a house".
// And the caller's bound: a reader waits CALLER_WAIT_MS, then is told so by
// name, while the one batch it was waiting on runs on into the cache.
//
// Synthetic only: a spy store answers the registry, the roll and last-active's
// own statement. The held-lock proof on a real Postgres is
// porch-lights-store.test.mjs's.
