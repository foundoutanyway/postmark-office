// portal-ground.test.mjs — the portal ground's own law, which outlived the arena
// (Keemin closed the arena 2026-09-30; the rooms it was played in are still
// walked: the candle vault "keeps the proof", the cellar door keeps you
// silverware-small at "a stride is a quarter-metre").
//
//   the stride   `walk_min_step` snaps a walk's destination inside the ground,
//                and a ground that declares none snaps nothing
//   the landing  a ground with `lands_at` sets its entrants down inside its own
//                fence, witnessed-jittered, and a landing outside it is refused
//                (WLD-66: "spawn" is the creatures' word; the old `spawn` key still reads)
//   the door     `standpoint.portal` carries the room, its space and its stride
//   no fight     no ground keeps a wheel
//
// Ported from the arena suite's portal-ground tests (office train/2026-w41
// before the arena closed), with the fight taken out. The fixture's rooms are
// the town's own shapes: every one is class `portal-ground`, as on the record.
