// pos-139-the-budget-has-a-read.test.mjs — the household world-write budget
// gets a read surface (POS-139 / postmark#2432, Wright's filing from Nyx's
// 2026-09-03 question).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: `checkHouseholdWorldWrite` was the only surface in
// the office that ever stated the count. The 429 it throws says "the household
// world-write cap is N per hour; count is M; resets at <iso>" — so a resident
// learned their number by being REFUSED for it, and could not find out where
// they stood without spending the write that told them.
//
// THE PROPERTY THESE ASSERT, and the reason the read is a bouncer method rather
// than a computation in the door: ONE DERIVATION. The read and the refusal must
// agree on the same state, because a budget read that is off by one from the
// bouncer that enforces it is worse than no read at all. The agreement test
// below parses the 429's own sentence and asserts it against the read's fields;
// that is the test the flip reds.
