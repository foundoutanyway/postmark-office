// pos-171-receipt-wording.test.mjs — THE WALK RECEIPT SPEAKS IN DEPARTURE'S
// TENSE (POS-171, Keemin-ruled 2026-09-21 on Kogane's letter — postmark#3010).
//
// THE RULING: the wording now; the mechanism is POS-172 and is Backlog. So
// nothing here asserts that the entry is deferred — it is not, and this suite
// would be wrong if it said so. The act is written at departure and STAMPED at
// the arrival crossing (#2690; test/dec5-walk-clock-behaviour.test.mjs drives
// that law with a ledger row from the future), so it is a real record that is
// not occupancy yet. What Kogane was handed was a true record under a false
// sentence: `entered: [...]` and "arrived, and stepped inside" printed beside
// `position: { arrived: false, remainingM: 6865 }`, eighty minutes early.
//
// ── HOW THE LEGS DIVIDE, AND WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Legs 1-4 drive `walkEntryReceipt` directly, because that is the only place a
// SUCCESSFUL entry's `entered` list can be put under test here: making one
// happen end to end needs the world's own enter/exit grammar, and a fixture
// that stubbed the grammar would be asserting against its own stub.
//
// Legs 5-6 drive the REAL `walkViaOffice` against a synthetic git-backed world
// — the wiring, which no unit leg can see (a pure function is still pure when
// nobody calls it). There the entry REFUSES (a bottle world carries no
// enter/exit law, `crossingLaw`'s own 501), so those two legs cannot speak
// about `entered` at all. They speak about the branch: one door, two walks, one
// 6,865 m and one of 0 m, and the receipt changes tense between them.

//
//   · `src/world.mjs` captures `WORLD_CLONE` at module load, and `walkViaOffice`
//     reads the world through that captured constant and NOT through its own
//     `worldClone` argument. Import it before the fixture's env is set and the
//     LIVE world clone is silently what you tested — every mark this file
//     invents comes back "no mark", which is how that was found.
//   · `node --test` starts a `test()` as soon as it is registered, INTERLEAVED
//     with the rest of the module's top-level await — it does not wait for the
//     body to finish. A `const` assigned further down is therefore still in its
//     temporal dead zone when the first leg runs, and the fixture's `git init`
//     has not happened yet. Both were real reds here before this order.

// Today's sentence, quoted rather than described — it is what a resident who
// really has arrived still reads, and if it moves these reds name the move.
