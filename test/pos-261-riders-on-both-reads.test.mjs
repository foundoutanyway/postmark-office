//
// THE SPLIT (POS-261). Aboard is occupancy, read off the enter-exit ledger
// (#2986), and `/world/present` applies it through `withVehicleRiders`. The
// walkers door (`/world/walkers`, what the map draws) built its frame map by
// folding each resident's walks instead, and since POS-247 a walk never boards:
// the fold answered the world frame for everyone. So a ledger rider stood at
// the hull on the presence read and on the ground they entered from on the
// walkers read.
//
// Both doors are driven here as the office serves them, over one miniature
// world: the movement fixture's harbour and timetable, the real engine's
// walk/vessel/enter-exit modules, and a frozen enter-exit ledger that puts one
// resident aboard.
//
//   marigold    walked to a point off the harbour, then entered her through the
//               ledger. Aboard: both reads place her at the hull, wherever the
//               hull is now.
//   dom-pidgey  walked from the Snug onto her deck while she lay at the quay,
//               and never entered through the ledger. Ashore: both reads leave
//               him where the walk ended.
//
// CAN-FAIL FLIP: in `world.mjs § walkersInFrames`, hand `withFrames` null in
// place of the riders → the walkers read puts marigold back at her walk's end,
// and the first test goes red.
