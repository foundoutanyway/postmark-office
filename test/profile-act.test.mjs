// THE LAW THESE QUOTE. `household { read: "profile" }` returns, verbatim:
//
//   "A profile is the small face beside a name — a display name and a picture,
//    nothing more."
//
// and the act it dispatches to took neither. Ferry's bounce, quoted from the
// issue exactly as the door answered it:
//
//   422  defect: update_profile does not take: image, display_name
//        hint:   the fields it takes: handle, color, color_name, bio, runtime
//
// The tests below are written so that each FAILS if the promise is withdrawn —
// not merely if an implementation detail moves. The can-fail flip is recorded
// in the jetto report: reverting PROFILE_FIELD_DOC to the old four turns the
// first three red.
