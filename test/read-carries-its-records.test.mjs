// read-carries-its-records.test.mjs — falsifiers for `records` (2026-09-10).
//
// THE PROMISE, stated as a biconditional so it can fail in both directions:
//
//   every id this response NAMES has a record here,
//   and every record here is either NAMED by this response or on the town's
//   ground set — and nothing else.
//
// A field that carried too much would be the fold creeping back in through a
// door built to avoid it; a field that carried too little would leave a reader
// holding an id it cannot resolve, which is the exact gap `records` exists to
// close. One-directional tests would pass against both defects, so neither is
// written that way.
//
// THE GROUND SET IS COMPUTED HERE FROM THE RECORD, not read back out of
// world.mjs. A test that asked the implementation what the ground is would
// assert that the implementation agrees with itself. So this file does the join
// again, from `REGION_SLUGS` and the skeleton's own water selection — the two
// sources the viewer's `townRegionMarks`/`townWaterShapes` read — and compares.
