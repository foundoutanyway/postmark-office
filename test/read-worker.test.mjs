//   "Gate the read workers with a falsifier asserting they hold no write grant

//        — runbook.md § DEC-4, founder-recommended, standing unopposed
//
// The claim has three limbs and this file walks all three against a REAL booted
// worker over its real HTTP door. None of them is checked by reading source
// text: a check on the code's text is not a check on its behaviour, so every
// leg here drives the process and reads what came back.
//
//   § 1  the ROUTE refusal — every unsafe door answers 405 and names the writer
//   § 2  the READ half — the worker-safe doors still answer, so the refusal is
//        a gate and not a wall (a worker that refused everything would pass a
//        route test and be worthless)
//   § 3  NO SQLITE HANDLE IN WRITE MODE — the store is made genuinely unwritable
//        underneath the running worker and its reads are asked to keep working.
//        This is the leg that can actually fail, and it did before the fix.
//   § 4  NO WRITE GRANT — the pen token is present in the worker's environment
//        and absent from the worker.
//
// THE FLIP THIS FILE IS BUILT AGAINST: remove `--role read` from the boot args
// in § 1 and the whole section goes red, because a writer answers those doors.
