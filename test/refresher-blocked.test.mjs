// refresher-blocked.test.mjs — POS-263's falsifier: with the world refresher's
// git held for 30 s, /release still answers in under 100 ms while world reads
// keep being answered.
//
// THE LAW, quoted from the brief: "Falsifier: with the refresher deliberately
// blocked for 30 s, /release still answers in under 100 ms."
//
// HOW THE REFRESHER IS BLOCKED, FOR REAL. It is not stubbed. Every git process
// started while the hold is on reads its global config from a path that a
// separate holder process owns and does not answer for 30 s: a named pipe on
// Windows, a FIFO elsewhere. The holder lives in its own process on its own clock,
// so a blocked event loop here cannot keep it from letting go. The refresher is
// then told to refresh, and its git children sit in that read.
//
// WHAT IS POLLED, AND FROM WHERE. /release in the office is a constant, and it
// was 15–60 s on the Snug Harbour night only because the event loop was held
// by synchronous git. The event loop is what is on trial, so the stand-in here
// is the same kind of door on the same loop as the world reads. The poller is a
// child process, so a frozen loop here cannot hide its own latency from it.
// Meanwhile a timer asks the world readers every 5 ms, as request traffic would.
//
// THE FLIP (recorded in the lane's paperwork): make world-branches' `git` skip
// the refresher. The readers then start git themselves, their children block
// on the same held config, the loop freezes, and the poller's worst latency
// goes to the hold's length.
