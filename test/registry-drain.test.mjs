// registry-drain.test.mjs — the drain's decision path, with no database (POS-187).
//
// `tools/registry-drain.mjs --check` is the gate the whole flip hangs on, and
// `--apply` is the writer that makes the town's two files a rendering of the
// store. Neither may first be exercised on the box at 05:45.
//
// THE POOL IS STUBBED, NOT MOCKED AROUND. `world2-acts.mjs` exports
// `__setPoolForTest` for exactly this, and the stub answers the drain's three
// real queries with rows shaped the way `node-postgres` shapes them — `gh_id`
// as a STRING (bigint), `accounts` as parsed jsonb, `ord` as a number. So the
// path under test is the real `loadRegistryRows` -> `renderRegistry` -> the
// pen, not a rehearsal of it.
//
// THE PEN IS INJECTED, exactly as `declareHousehold` injects its `commit` and
// for the same reason: the decision — write, or write nothing — is what is
// being proven, and a real `penCommit` would need a clone, a bot identity and a
// remote to prove a branch that has nothing to do with any of them.
