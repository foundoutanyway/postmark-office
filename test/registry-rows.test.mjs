// registry-rows.test.mjs — THE ROUND-TRIP LAW, proven on the real files (POS-187).
//
// The household registry becomes store-of-record in 019_households.sql. The
// one thing that makes that safe is this law:
//
//     renderRegistry(rowsFromRegistry(the two files)) === the two files,
//                                                        byte for byte
//
// `tools/registry-drain.mjs --check` enforces it on the box, against whatever
// the clone holds that morning, and its red is the whole flip stopping. This
// file enforces the SAME law here, on the town's REAL files as of 2026-09-22
// (origin/main df732534a) — 118 households and 190 pins, copied byte-exact
// into test/fixtures/registry-2026-09-22/ and pinned to LF by .gitattributes'
// own `test/fixtures/** text eol=lf` guard, which exists for exactly this
// reason.
//
// A fixture of three invented houses would prove the code composes with
// itself. These are the town's own bytes, with every shape the live registry
// actually wears: a house with no `name`, a house with no `human`, a house with
// `member_of`, two path-hostile slugs, two accounts on one house, 12 pins with
// no `pinned` date, and pins carrying `renamed`, `note`, `retired` and
// `renamed_to`.

/**
 * The rows as POSTGRES WOULD HAND THEM BACK, not as JavaScript built them.
 *
 * This is the whole point of the reader half. `node-postgres` returns a
 * `bigint` column as a STRING — it will not silently narrow one to a float —
 * and the file spells a pin's `id` as a NUMBER. A test that fed hand-built rows
 * straight back into the renderer would never meet that, and the first real
 * `--check` on the box would red on 190 lines at once. `ord` comes back as a
 * number from int4.
 *
 * AND `accounts` COMES BACK KEY-SORTED. This function used to pass the jsonb
 * columns through as they were, which made this suite a store that behaves
 * better than Postgres: it was green on 2026-09-22 while the dev sandbox's
 * `registry-drain.mjs --check` red with `tools/households.json differs at line
 * 9 — store renders "id": 306985727, / the clone has "login":
 * "vertas-marginalia",`. jsonb is a sorted map, not an object; the rule is
 * length-in-bytes then bytes, it is written down once in
 * `test/jsonb-key-order.mjs`, and it is applied here so the pure law and the
 * box's law are the same law.
