// rekey-household.test.mjs — POS-299: a household gets a new key and name, and nothing else moves.
//
// Emmett Songbound's human typed the house's whole introduction as its name, so
// its key is an 858-character slug and she speaks as `human-of-<paragraph>`.
// The tool renames the one household (the store row, the printed registry, the
// residents' card lines, one appended ledger line) and keeps its residents,
// pins and membership. The door then refuses a name that is prose.
//
// THE PATH UNDER TEST IS THE REAL ONE: the real store module over the in-memory
// pool (`test/registry-pool-stub.mjs`), the real registry drain, and the real
// `penCommit` into a temp git clone. Only the pen's signature stands in; the
// flip against the live ledger (the lane's paperwork) is where a real ledger is
// verified.
