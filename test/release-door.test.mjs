// release-door.test.mjs — POS-60: `GET /release` over the real HTTP door.
//
// The unit falsifier (test/release-stamp.test.mjs) pins the READER. This one pins
// the DOOR, because the reader being right is worth nothing if the route does not
// exist, is not public, or is served from a hot re-read instead of the boot read.
//
// THE LAW, quoted verbatim from deploy/DEPLOY.md's live-truth note (2026-07-19):
//
//   "a code deploy is `scp src/<changed>.mjs meepo-ec2:/srv/postmark-office/src/`
//    + `sudo systemctl restart postmark-office`, then probe a route whose
//    response only the new code produces (a restart alone proves nothing)."
//
// The auto-deploy in .github/workflows/release-train.yml polls exactly this route
// and refuses to go green until it answers with the tag and sha it just shipped.
// So the three properties below are the ones that workflow's gate rests on:
//
//   1. the route answers 200 WITHOUT a key — an Actions runner probing prod, and
//      the operator on the box's loopback, both hold no household key;
//   2. it reports the tag and sha from the stamp on disk at boot;
//   3. it is BOOT-read, not hot-read — rewriting release.json under a running
//      office does NOT change the answer. That is what makes the probe a proof of
//      restart rather than a proof of file-copy.
//
