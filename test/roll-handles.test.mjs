// roll-handles.test.mjs — the roll carries RESIDENTS, and nothing else.
//
// The live receipt from the step-10 deploy carried a row
// `{ handle: "_archived", source: "quay" }`. That directory is the town's
// retirement shelf, not a resident, and the quay is where the office puts a
// resident it cannot otherwise place (`the-town/the-standing-porch`) — so the
// town's own map showed a folder standing on the porch.
//
// THE ROLL UNION DID NOT INTRODUCE IT; IT MADE IT VISIBLE. The office indexes
// the town through the vendored `readTown`, whose resident enumeration is
//
//     listDir(wpDir).filter((n) => isDir(join(wpDir, n)) && n !== "TEMPLATE")
//
// — it skips the blank form and nothing else. So `_archived` has been a row in
// the `residents` table all along, and every reader over that table has been
// carrying it: `/residents`, `list_residents`, the town counts. The roll union
// merely asked the one question that renders the roll as PEOPLE STANDING
// SOMEWHERE, which is where a folder on the porch becomes obvious.
//
// The fix is therefore at the class, not the instance: the office's own
// admission grammar — the rule that decides what may become a handle at the
// door — decides what may be indexed AS a handle and what may be served as one.
// One definition, imported by both, so there is no second grammar to drift.
