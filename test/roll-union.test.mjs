//
//   the-town/the-standing-porch  (resident class) — "the quay, when the record
//       places them nowhere else." The engine answers that correctly as of world
//       fd965b7c. This suite is about the office ASKING about the residents it
//       answers for.
//   the-town/the-disclosure      (logos) — "refuse or disclose absent inputs;
//       never quietly substitute." Both halves lean on it: a walkers answer
//       given no roll says so, and a degraded world read must never be dressed
//       up as a resident's missing paperwork.
