// set-down-files-the-amend.test.mjs — POS-138, the office half.
//
// THE LAW: `LOGOS/classes.md` § The reach of a hold — a set-down's "position
// is written on the act and is canon at the next fold like any move". A move is
// an AMEND through the office's pen (`LOGOS/state-and-time.md`: "the settlement
// writes a mark once; nothing moves it after").
//
// THE INSTANCE: Keith set his own stool down in the Waiting Room (postmark#2693,
// act 1636, 2026-09-10). The hold door told him "the record re-sites the mark at
// the next fold" and filed nothing, so canon kept the stool in his garage
// through nine folds while the read said it stood in the Waiting Room.
//
// THE RULING (Keemin, 2026-09-24): the author's pen moves the author's own
// thing without ceremony; a set-down by ANOTHER household moves nothing in
// canon until the author's house accepts it, and the read says so.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE DRIVES: the real hold door (`callHoldTool`) on the hold
// lane as prod runs it (flipped, guards on — POS-269 retired the dynamic store
// that held the edge anywhere else), whose drop reaches the real leave-mark door
// (`leaveMarkViaOffice` → `journalLeaveMark` → `appendActFlipped` →
// `claimTxFromJournal`), against an in-memory record (`acts-pen-stub.mjs`) that
// keeps every act and claim it is handed. Nothing here is a copy of the amend
// shape: the rows asserted are the rows the door wrote.
//
// THE SECOND HALF (Keemin, 2026-09-24 ~10:1x, "I agree with you here", on
// PR #180's proposal) is at the foot of this file: the author's house answers a
// stranger's set-down through the real stance door — accept, refuse, silence,
// and the author-only speaker refusal.
