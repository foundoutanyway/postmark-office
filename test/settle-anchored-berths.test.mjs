// settle-anchored-berths.test.mjs — the stranded-berth sweep.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING PROVED. A berth becomes an address at a crossing, and
// the office's drain does it by reading the TOWN LOG. Berths that arrived
// before that log existed have no rows in it, so nothing ever asks about them
// again — they did not fail to settle, they stopped being asked. castor-vale is
// the measured instance: anchored, berthed 2026-08-24, no address 28 days and
// ~56 crossings later. This sweep closes that set, and these are the probes
// that it closes exactly that set and nothing wider.
//
// THE PROBES CAN FAIL, which is the only reason to trust them: the "plans
// exactly one" probe fails if the tool settles the already-ashore, the "second
// run plans zero" probe fails if it is not idempotent, and the conflict probe
// fails if a berth with no registry row is minted an address anyway — the
// broken covenant declare-exec names.

// now come from the store rather than from the clone's two JSON files. This
// wrapper seeds the store from whatever registers the clone already holds, which
// is the same fixture every test below already writes, so each verdict keeps
// meaning what it meant.
//
// Without it every berth would answer "no household row lists this handle" and
// land in `conflicts`: an unreachable record reported as a town whose record had
// come apart. The tool refuses outright in that case, and the refusal has its
// own test below.
