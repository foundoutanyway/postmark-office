//
// THE LAW. /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-auto.json answers one question —
// what did the LAST crossing do — and it is overwritten twice a day, so it
// structurally cannot hold a pattern. The patterns are the findings:
//
//   "On 2026-08-26 a crossing left 42 marks drafted and reported nothing; a
//    starving crossing printed '0 published, 0 unpublished' and read as a quiet
//    day for two days."  (deploy/settlement-receipt.mjs, its own header)
//
//   "These two were the sweep's standing 2-error lint refusal (every crossing
//    since 08-28 re-drained them, dropped one, tripped on the other)."
//    (postmark-world 7f866059, the repair that finally cleared it)
//
// Every receipt in both stretches was individually honest. This file is the
// only place either pattern can exist, so its two obligations are that a
// crossing lands here exactly once, and that a NON-crossing does not land at all.
