//
// THE RIG. A real Postgres (embedded-store.mjs) holding one settlement whose
// snapshot carries one household's parcels, and the marks and claims rows a
// parcel's FIRST claim is read from (world-snapshot.mjs § withClaimedAt). The
// engine is the world's own, materialised from the office's world clone at
// ENGINE: world#166, the first engine that orders parcels by their first claim
// (and carries world#146's town word, which is how a limit is carried). The
// pinned clone's own HEAD predates both, and serves as the old-engine control.
//
// ⚑ MERGE ORDER: world#166 before this file can pass on CI. The suite fetches
// world main's objects, so ENGINE is in the clone once #166 is on main; before
// that the engine check below fails by name, never skips.
