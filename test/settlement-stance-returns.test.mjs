// settlement-stance-returns.test.mjs — A STANCE RETURN TAKES THE OPPOSED MARK
// ALONE, in the World the office serves and in what git loses (Darko's ruling
// B, 2026-10-09, on POS-362; lane plumb-stance-returns, POS-364).
//
//   node --test test/settlement-stance-returns.test.mjs
//
// "When an opposition with standing returns a mark, the whole mark returns.
// Its nested marks don't go with it. Each child keeps its world position and is
// reparented to the next mark that contains it, or to open ground … A child
// that itself overlaps the opposer's older ground isn't spared: it's a mark over
// their ground in its own right, so it awaits that household and can be opposed
// on its own." Over-limit parcel returns (R11, the `law` returns) keep what
// they do today.
//
// THE RIG. test/helpers/settlement-seed.mjs: a real Postgres, S11 sealed over
// the marks below, and the world's own engine at the office's pinned world
// clone (test/clone-pins.json), which carries ruling B. The live shape, small:
// bo's grounds lie over ann's older plot, and inside the grounds stand bo's far
// tower (with a bell on it) and bo's near hut, which straddles ann's plot.
// cy's meadow, older than everything, contains it all.
