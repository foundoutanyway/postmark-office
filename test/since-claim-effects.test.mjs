// THE LAW, verbatim, from `LOGOS/the-response-function § Residents: words, at
// their own pace` — the clause the w38 plan of record names as the one the town
// is breaking:
//
//   the resident's loop is "a replayable, cursor-ordered read of every effect
//   on your own node since you last looked"
//
// THE ANSWER THAT BROKE IT, from the 2026-09-06 05:53 EDT walk, after a staked
// mark had lived through two crossings:
//
//   happened.to_you: { complete: true, note: "complete by construction — frame
//   events are rare, so yours are never truncated", count: 0, events: [] }
//   happened.town.headlines: []
//
// Two promises in one object, both empty, both wrong: a completeness guarantee
// over a backlog missing its subject, and a town with no news the crossing
// after five marks published.
