// Falsifiers for site-sentinel.
//
// The law these assert is the founder's sentence of 2026-08-25, quoted verbatim
// wherever a test claims the alert fires:
//
//     "how can we LOUDLY BE NOTIFIED when something is down on the site?"
//
// Two sentences that shape what "loud" has to mean here, and which several of
// these tests exist specifically to hold:
//   - loud is not frequent. A per-tick ping is wallpaper; the reader mutes it,
//     and a muted channel reproduces the silence exactly. So the reminder
//     falsifier below is as load-bearing as the onset one.
//   - degrading must be visible. A watch that cannot reach its channel must
//     still take every reading, still write its board, and still SAY so.

//
//   "The crossing-aware watchdog: site-sentinel compares the site's crossing
//    number to reality's, instead of (only) a wall-clock age threshold — a
//    wall-clock threshold cannot see an event-shaped failure."
//
// THE DEFECT THEY CLOSE is the 2026-08-26 incident: prod's delivery stalled 97
// minutes past a ferry crossing and 48 residents' doorstep pages served
// yesterday's mail. Every wall-clock probe in this file was green throughout,
// because the site HAD rebuilt recently — it had just rebuilt the wrong side of
// a ferry. The first test below is that incident, to the minute.

// ── §7: the site refresh's OUTCOME (2026-09-17, postmark-town/postmark#2884) ─
//
// THE INSTANCE. At 08:12:35Z the box published a town with 48 doors missing,
// from a three-week-old committed snapshot. The board read 14 green at
// 08:20:02Z. Nothing on the board was wrong — nothing on it was looking at the
// refresh at all. The refresh writes its own report; this is the probe that
// reads it.
//
// THE REPORT'S SHAPE IS THE BOX'S, NOT ONE INVENTED HERE. Copied from
// /srv/postmark-harbor/site-refresh.json as it stood at 2026-09-17T08:10:00Z,
// which is the run of the instance itself:
//
//   { "at": "2026-09-17T08:10:00Z", "status": "published",
//     "town_sha": "9468d6e3...", "site_main": "26d75407...",

//     "passes": 2, "detail": "converged after 2 pass(es) at town 9468d6e3" }
//
// A STANDING FINDING THAT BELONGS BESIDE THESE TESTS: that report — the
// instance's OWN report — says `published`. The report is written once, at the
// end of a run, and a run whose first pass published short and whose second
// pass converged ends `published`. So THIS PROBE ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN GREEN
// FOR THE 08:10Z RUN. It is postmark-site#97's exit that makes the pair work: a
// short fetch there dies the run at deploy/site-refresh.sh L428, `die` writes
// `report failed`, and this probe reads it. Neither half is the guard on its
// own, and this comment is here so nobody later reads this probe as one.
