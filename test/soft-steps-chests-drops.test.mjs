// soft-steps-chests-drops.test.mjs — the keep tick's chests and drops steps reach
// the one alarm route (POS-627, from review-612's POS-612 re-check).
//
//   node --test test/soft-steps-chests-drops.test.mjs
//
// settlements-backfill.mjs --apply runs four soft steps after the settlement
// rows: carried, chests, amends and drops. Each is non-fatal by design (rows
// written stay written, the run exits 0, `settlements` reads ok), so a step
// failing on every tick alarmed nowhere. POS-612 recorded carried and amends as
// their own keep steps; this does the same for chests (WLD-27's first stock)
// and drops (WLD-27 F0's orphaned set-downs).
//
// THE LINES ARE THE STEPS' OWN. Every line below is produced by the real step
// function (stockedOnTick, chestsAfterCarried, stockChests on a store that
// answers the law query, dropsRecoveredOnTick), so a reworded line reds here
// instead of silently reading "refused" on the box.
//
// ONE MAPPING WAS A DECISION, not a reading (Wright 10-14): public world main
// declares no chest class (the candy heist is the private spire fork), so on
// prod the chests step answers "not stocked — the law at S<n> declares no chest
// class" on every tick. That is the honest empty, like "stocked 0": ok, with the
// reason prereq:chest_class kept on the receipt so the dress rehearsal can watch it
// turn into "stocked N" once the class lands. A store
// with no ingested law at all is a broken prerequisite: refused prereq:law, and
// so is "no chest class" while a NEWER blessing's law is not ingested yet (a
// stalled ingest could be hiding the class; review-612 F1).
//
// AND ONE RULING ON DROPS (Wright 10-14, review-612 F2): a guard's designed
// bounce is undecided, asked again: ok. A write the store refused (a raw error,
// or a filed drop whose resolution could not be recorded) fails again every
// tick: it is its own `N failed (…)` segment, read refused write-failed.
//
// THE CAN-FAIL FLIPS: drop `keep_step chests` or `keep_step drops` from
// office-keep.sh; drop either from SOFT_STEPS or from the manifest; read any
// chests or drops line as ok. Each reds a case below.
