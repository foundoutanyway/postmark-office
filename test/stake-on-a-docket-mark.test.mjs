// A STAKE ON A MARK ALREADY ON THE OPEN DOCKET IS AN ORDINARY STAKE
// (postmark-town/postmark#3139, Marigold, 2026-09-25).
//
// Marigold re-hung a withdrawn mark with `leave-mark` + `amend` + `stamps`. It
// went PENDING on window 211's docket, and its `marks` row stayed `retired`,
// because only a crossing publishes it again. Then `world_stake` on it bounced
// 422 "is not standing — it returned to your drafts", with a hint to leave it
// again or stake the draft: an act that would have put it forward twice.
//
// The docket was the fact the door never read. `markStandingStatus` now carries
// the open window a pending claim rides (`docket_window`, same statement), and
// `stakeRefusalFor` takes it as its own input and lets the stake through. The
// town ledger keys escrow on the MARK (tools/world-stake.mjs § worldStakeApply,
// `markEscrow` = state.escrow.get(mark)), and the promotion only ever promotes a
// DRAFT row, so the stake adds to what stands behind the one pending claim and
// files no second one. These cases drive the real promotion and the real
// standing reader through the fake pen; the ledger is a spy.
//
// NOT PROVEN HERE: the widened SQL against real Postgres. The fake pen models
// the statement; it does not run it.
