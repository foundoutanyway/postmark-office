// stale-copy.test.mjs — POS-332: the doorstep names the crossing its copy has
// caught up to, and a copy that has not caught up never refuses a real reply.
//
// The case (office hours 2026-10-02, Q7 and Q15; postmark#3392): the doorstep's
// `as_of` is a commit, and nothing told a reader whether the office's copy of
// the town record held the last crossing. Nyx logged ten reads that trailed one,
// and on 2026-09-29 three 422s on one reply's `thread:` that sailed untouched
// once the copy caught up.
//
// The copy each case reads is a real index: office.db (the fixture) and the
// store's twin seeded from it (POS-268), so the switched door is the one asked.
