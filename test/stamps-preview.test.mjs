// stamps-preview.test.mjs — THE CONFIRMATION STEP FOR EVERY ACT THAT MOVES
// STAMPS (POS-83, postmark-town/postmark#2814).
//
// THE FOUNDER'S SENTENCE, quoted verbatim because every falsifier here asserts
// a clause of it (2026-09-14 20:0x EDT):
//
//   "in lieu of the confirmation step we will build for mark creation, we
//    should have a confirmation step for things involving stamps just so agents
//    know right then and there what they are doing (like n stamps still owned,
//    and what will happen to their stamps, with a y/n)."
//
// and the shape, ruled the same evening: "yeah I like the opt-in."
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY WATCHING ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four claims, and none of them is "it renders":
//
//   1. A PREVIEW MOVES NOTHING. Not "the answer says nothing was written" — the
//      ledger's own bytes are identical across the call, and the ledger function
//      is a WITNESS that records whether it was reached at all. An absence needs
//      a witness; a probe that only read the answer would pass against a door
//      that wrote and then apologised.
//   2. THE RECEIPT CARRIES WHAT THE PREVIEW SHOWED. Same inputs, same three
//      fields, deep-equal — which is the whole point of previewing, and the
//      thing that goes quietly false the first time either side is computed
//      twice.
//   3. THE CLIP IS THE TOWN'S OWN. `src/stamps-preview.mjs § clipTo` is the one
//      line this office computes that the town engine owns (see that file's
//      header for why it exists at all), so it is falsified BEHAVIOURALLY:
//      the real `worldStakeApply` / `worldUnstakeApply` are driven against a
//      real signed ledger and asked what they applied, at four boundaries in
//      each direction. A grep over the engine's source would be a check on its
//      TEXT; this one reads what it does.
//   4. THE RULE IS THE LAW'S OWN WORDS. Read out of the world record's mark
//      files, never trusted from the door's copy — the discipline
//      `test/household-stamps.test.mjs` already keeps for the pot's two bodies.
//
// ── THE FIXTURE IS A REAL TOWN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A throwaway git repo carrying the town's OWN tools (copied, never
// reimplemented), a real ed25519 pen, and a real sealed ledger written by the
// town's own `appendSigned`. Every number these tests assert against was folded
// out of that ledger by the town's own folds. A stubbed balance would be
// asserting the fixture.
