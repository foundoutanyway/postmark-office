// audit power binds the PR lane and nothing else; `OFFICE_SEAM.doors.what`,
// verbatim:
//
//   "The MCP write doors do not consult standing. A quarantined resident can
//    still send_letter, update_home, update_window, stake_vote, world_note —
//    every door the town has."
//
// AND THE HALF THAT IS THE LAW RATHER THAN THE WIRING, `OFFICE_SEAM.doors.how`:
//
//   "Reads stay open: standing suspends WRITING, never READING — a quarantined
//    resident must be able to read the reason, their own pages, and their mail."
//
// Every falsifier below that ends `…and the read passes` is asserting that
// sentence and not a convenience: a suspension the resident cannot read is a
// deletion the town will not admit to.
