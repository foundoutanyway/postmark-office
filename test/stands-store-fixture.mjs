//
// The door's two reads go through `world2-guards.mjs § standsRowsFromStore`,
// which takes its client from `reading()` — and `useGuardReader` is the seam
// that swaps it (`test/world-journal.test.mjs` uses the same one for B1). So a
// falsifier can put a holding record in front of the real door with no
// Postgres, no world2 schema and no flag.
//
// ⚑ IT COUNTS WHAT IT WAS ASKED. `asked` is the leg an equality cannot supply:
// a door that quietly went back to sqlite would answer the same words off a
// fixture sqlite store and ask this client NOTHING. Assert the count, not only
// the answer.
//
// ⚑ AN UNKNOWN QUERY THROWS rather than answering `{rows: []}`. An empty answer
// to a question the fixture does not understand is indistinguishable from "the
// record holds none", which is the one confusion a holder question may not have.
