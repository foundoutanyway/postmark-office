// store-refresh.test.mjs — the poll's store read: one in flight, bounded in
// Postgres, and never more than its own two connections (POS-639; the reviews
// of office#591 and #595).
//
// THE DEFECTS THIS CLOSES. office#591 gave the poll a guard so a tick skips
// while the last roll+probe pair is still reading, with no time bound: one hung
// read would have stopped every index refresh, silently. #595's first answer
// freed the guard at a JS bound but left the connections held, so a slow store
// let the poll take a third connection and queue for a fourth. The pen pool is
// three per thread and serves every resident read and write there. Now each
// read carries statement_timeout, and the guard waits for the read to settle.
//
// THE FLIPS: free the guard at the JS bound again (the #595 shape) and § 4's
// connection count passes 2; drop the statement timeout and § 4's reads never
// settle while the store is locked.
