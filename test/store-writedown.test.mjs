// store-writedown.test.mjs — THE STORE'S WRITE-DOWN, falsified (G1 lane 3).
//
//   node --test test/store-writedown.test.mjs
//
// THE CENTREPIECE is F3, and it is the only test here that could not have been
// written before this lane: it drives the SAME declaration down both paths — the
// drain's journal write-down and the store's — and asserts the two produce the
// identical blob sha. That is what makes "the store path writes the bytes the
// git path wrote" a falsifiable claim rather than an argument about two callers
// both intending to use `markRecord`. Its can-fail flip is a one-character edit
// to a field the record carries.
//
// The second cluster (F1) is the trap this module exists to close. A settlement
// clone is long-lived and carries `refs/remotes/origin/draft/*` from the git
// era; the world's sweep surveys local and remote draft refs together
// (`settlement-sweep.mjs:325-338`) and materializes remote-only ones into local
// tracking branches (`:364-379`). So a store crossing that merely stopped
// fetching sketchbooks would still fold every stale one, under a receipt saying
// `source: store`. F1 asserts the refs are gone AND that the assertion itself
// would notice if they were not.
//
// The refusal cluster (F4) exists because the brief's word is "refusing loudly
// when the store cannot answer", and a refusal nobody tested is a `catch` block.
// Each one asserts the REASON, not just that something threw — an operator reads
// the reason out of the receipt at 05:45Z and it has to be the right one.
