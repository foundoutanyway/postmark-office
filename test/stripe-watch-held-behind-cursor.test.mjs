//   node --test test/stripe-watch-held-behind-cursor.test.mjs
//
// ── THE FAILURE THIS RETIRES (postmark#2973, 2026-09-19) ────────────────────
//
// Session `stripe:cs_live_a1SNa9Fw…` — $10.28 to `keeping-ec2`, handle typed
// `soren`, paid, created 2026-09-16T01:09Z — has a `seen` row in
// /srv/postmark-stripe/stripe-intake.jsonl at 01:22Z and no `witnessed` row
// three days later. Every tick since reports
//
//   "1 completed session(s) since … · witnessed now: 0 · holding: 0 ·
//    already on the ledger: 1"
//
// and `holding: 0` is printed over a row the journal itself remembers as
// seen-and-unwitnessed. `tools/funding-report.mjs` re-decides the same session
// today as READY TO WITNESS. The report and the watcher disagreed, and the
// report was right.
//
// THE MECHANISM IS ONE LINE OF THE TICK. `main()` lists from `state.cursor` and
// `decide()` returns `max(created)` over that listing. The payer's LATER session
// (soren's $10 to `darko-fund`) shared the listing, so the cursor stepped past
// the held one, and `created[gte]=cursor` never returns it again. The header's
// promise — "the journal remembers what was SEEN; the ledger decides what was
// DONE" — held for dedupe and not for re-decision: nothing re-read the journal.
//
// THE CURSOR IS FOR FINDING NEW SESSIONS, NOT FOR REMEMBERING HELD ONES. Each
// tick now also re-decides every journal row that is `seen` with no `witnessed`
// row, independent of the cursor — which is exactly what `stripeQueue` in
// funding-report.mjs has always done, so the fix makes the two agree rather
// than adding a second rule.
//
// ── WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   F1  the bug itself: a seen-unwitnessed row older than the cursor, an EMPTY
//       live listing, and the tick must decide it. RED at the train tip.
//   F2  the second lock: a session with a `witnessed` row is not re-decided at
//       all. The ledger's ref-uniqueness would bounce a double-witness, but the
//       watcher must not even try.
//   F3  the non-regression: the cursor still finds new sessions and still
//       advances over them. The bug is a cursor bug; fixing it must not be a
//       second cursor change.
//   F4  the freshness: when a session is in BOTH the live listing and the
//       journal, the LIVE decode wins. A journal row is a snapshot of the
//       session as it was FIRST seen — `payment_status` can still move from
//       unpaid to paid — so a journal row that shadowed the live read would
//       freeze a session at the moment it was worst understood. Green at the
//       tip (there is no journal read at all there); it is a pin on the shape
//       of the fix, and its flip is "let the journal win".
