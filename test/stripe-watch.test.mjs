// THE VALIDATION RULE (Keemin, 2026-08-21): every falsifier CITES THE SENTENCE
// OF LAW IT ASSERTS, quoted verbatim in the test itself.
//
// Stripe is INJECTED. The fake account here answers the query it is HANDED
// rather than replaying a canned list, so a test that claims "only completed
// sessions are read" is asserting something about the request we send and not
// about our own incuriosity — the same distinction usdc-watch.test.mjs draws
// about the chain filter.
//
// The LEDGER is REAL: every recorded receipt in this file is written by the
// TOWN'S OWN epoch-close CLI through the office's own fund-exec recorder, and
// read back through the town's own foldPotReceipts. A hand-rolled ledger scan
// or a hand-written row would be a second copy of the rule, and this whole lane
// exists because there must be exactly one.
