// the-towns-marks.test.mjs — POS-142: the town's marks keep `solo:the-town`
// BY NAME, as an interim, so the marks ingest can carry a town mark.
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-24 ~19:3x EDT: "the town should be some kind of entity, idk
// if household is correct, but yes the long-term shape is that the meeps should
// belong to the town." Wright proposed an interim (the town's marks keep
// `solo:the-town` by name, pinned by a test, committing to nothing about what
// the town is) and Keemin approved it: "I agree. good to have a lane build it
// tonight".
//
// The finding it answers: the dev sandbox's ingest run refused whole at
// `NO_SUCH_HOUSE`, because six of its adds are authored by `the-town` and the
// town is not a household on the roll. Since POS-160's Ruling 1 the pen mints
// no `solo:` at all (`materialize.mjs § ownerHouseholdFor`), so every ingest
// carrying a new town mark would refuse whole.
//
// These legs pin the ONE exception and its edges:
//   · a town claim materializes as `solo:the-town`, before the roll is asked;
//   · an unknown claimant who is not the town still refuses `NO_SUCH_HOUSE`;
//   · `solo:` is minted for no other handle — near-misses of the town's name
//     included;
//   · a claimant the roll names still gets `hh:<slug>`.
//
// The flip (the exception removed) reds the first legs: see the PR body.
//
// The stub is not Postgres. It answers the registry's three SELECTs and the
// marks INSERT `materializeClaims` makes, and refuses anything else.
