// town-drain-entrypoint.test.mjs — THE FERRY'S ACTUAL CALLER (POS-158).
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS BECAUSE OF ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `runTownDrain` became async when the registry became store-of-record. Every
// TEST harness was made async-aware in the same pass. The one PRODUCTION caller
// — `tools/town-drain-run.mjs`, which is what the ferry chain actually runs —
// was not: it read `const report = runTownDrain(...)`, so `report` was a
// Promise, `report.refused` was `undefined`, and `process.exit(0)` fired before
// the crossing had done anything at all.
//
// Measured A/B on a seeded db: before the async change a foreign-class crossing
// wrote four files and exited 1; after it, and before the fix, it wrote nothing,
// printed `{}` and exited 0. The ferry chain is `&&`-joined, so that reads as a
// clean crossing and the mail goes out on top of a record nobody settled.
//
// ── SO THIS SUITE SPAWNS THE TOOL, NOT THE LIBRARY ──────────────────────────
//
// Every other drain suite imports `runTownDrain` and awaits it, which is
// exactly why none of them could see this: they were testing a function the
// ferry does not call. This one runs `node tools/town-drain-run.mjs` as a
// process and reads what an operator reads — the files on disk and `$?`.
//
// It is the general lesson, and it is worth stating where the next person will
// meet it: WHEN A LIBRARY'S SIGNATURE CHANGES, THE SUITE THAT FOLLOWS IT IS NOT
// THE PROOF. The suite is the thing most likely to be updated in the same
// breath and least likely to be the caller that matters. The entrypoint is.
//
// ── THE STORE, AND ONLY THE STORE (POS-268 part 5b) ─────────────────────────
//
// The spawned tool reads its town index and its record from a store seeded from
// the fixture, because office.db is retired and the tool no longer opens one.
// Both assertions still discriminate:
//
//   · A LETTER row drains, so the crossing writes real files and exits 0. The
//     BROKEN caller also exited 0, and wrote NOTHING, so the file assertion is
//     what separates them.
//   · A join row with no verified identity is deferred (the tier line), nothing
//     holds the cursor, so the crossing refuses and the refusal has to reach
//     `$?`. The broken caller exited 0 there, so the exit code separates them.
//
// Two more pin the retirement itself: `--db` is refused before anything runs,
// and an environment without TOWN_INDEX_READS (no longer read, POS-656) still
// drains from the store.
