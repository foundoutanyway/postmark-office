// and on the same grounds the old comment argued from. "A letter is an act of
// your own pen" is exactly the register law's sentence — "your pen lives at
// household" — so the premise never changed; what changed is which conclusion
// it supports. The proposal that day recommended a fourth apex for mail and the
// founder overrode it: household already owns your pen, and a fourth door would
// have split the pen from the standing it writes with.
//
// What did NOT change is the boundary the old test was really guarding. The
// world's law still rules "MAIL IS NOT HERE AND NEVER WILL BE"; household is
// global exactly as town is — standing-scoped, never standpoint-scoped — so the
// fold keeps that promise rather than bending it. And the PUBLIC letter record
// (letters, letter, search) stays at town: mail is your correspondence, town is
