// town-stance.test.mjs — POS-361, the office half: the town's stance as law.
//
// The rulings each test holds, verbatim (Darko, 2026-10-06, deep slot 1, on
// POS-361):
//
//   "Words: the town reuses the resident tri-state. A declared neutral replaces
//    'ratified': it clears 'awaiting the town' and confers nothing. opposed is
//    unchanged. A town welcomed is adoption, reserved, and refused for now.
//    Silence leaves the mark awaiting."
//   "Verb: no new verb. The town speaks with declare-stance-on."
//   "Speaker: postmark-pen, household the-town, as town quest posts already
//    are. The act names the hand that held the pen. Hands: darko, wright,
//    worldkeeper."
//   "Citations: law marks only, in the shape the world lints already use (law =
//    the mark id, plus its text verbatim)."
//   "Cutover (Q4): the first settlement after Sunday's ship, set by Wright at
//    the deploy."
//   "Version (Q5): every stance records the mark version it was spoken on; a
//    stale version is absent, so an amendment reopens every word."
//   "Awaiting (Q6): the stance door's overlap rule, grouped by HOUSEHOLD, with
//    seniority (a parcel holder speaks only on marks younger than the parcel)."
//
// Each numbered test is the falsifier for the brief's item of the same number;
// its flip is named in its header and in the PR body.
