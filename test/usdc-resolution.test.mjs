// usdc-resolution.test.mjs — falsifiers for the rules usdc-watch grew when

// OF LAW IT ASSERTS, quoted verbatim in the test itself.
//
// The companion file test/usdc-watch.test.mjs still proves the theft this watch
// refuses to commit — an arrival recorded under a placeholder payer destroys the
// real patron's holo forever, against the town's own CLI. Nothing here weakens
// that. What is asserted here is the narrow shape for which its two premises are
// FALSE: an address a household has registered, at an address that names one
// pot. Everything outside that shape must still come out unclaimed, and several
// of these tests exist only to prove it does.
