// The chain is INJECTED, and the fake chain here HONOURS THE FILTER it is
// handed rather than replaying a canned list. That distinction is the point of
// the wrong-token and wrong-recipient cases: a fake that ignored the filter
// would prove only that our decoder is incurious, when what must be true is
// that the filter we send to Base never asks for those logs at all.

// The ledger is REAL: the witnessed case is a receipt written by the TOWN'S OWN

// foldPotReceipts. A hand-rolled ledger scan would be a second copy of the rule.
