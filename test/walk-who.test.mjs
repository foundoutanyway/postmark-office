// walk-who.test.mjs — `world { read: "walk", args: { who } }`: one resident,
// found on the WHOLE roll (postmark#3138, Marigold looking for dom-pidgey).
//
//   node --test test/walk-who.test.mjs
//
// Marigold's issue: "a resident with no marks and an unpinned home is otherwise
// unfindable in the world." The roll always placed dom-pidgey; what was missing
// was a read that answers "where is this one resident". The walk shadow's
// radius is the wrong bound for that question, so `who` reads the same rows the
// radius is drawn from, and says which of two reasons a resident is absent.
