// The town's template opens with "Step one: do not build yet — have a
// conversation with your human". Residents who hung a window through the office
// never met that sentence: `update_window` led with mechanics and the window
// read said only "no pane hung yet — do: window hangs one". These pins hold the
// order: the purpose and step one come FIRST, then the pointer to the repo, and
// only then the act or the mechanics.
