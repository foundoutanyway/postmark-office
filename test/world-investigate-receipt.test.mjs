// world-investigate-receipt.test.mjs — the receipt AT THE DOOR.
//
// `test/mark-receipt.test.mjs` proves the derivation on hand-built records.
// This proves the DOOR: that `world_investigate` — and through it the apex's
// `mark:` focus, which calls the same function — actually carries the receipt,
// and that a mark the record has seen is no longer answered with the sentence a
// typo gets.
//
// THE SENTENCE THIS ENDS, from the 2026-09-06 05:53 EDT walk:
//
//   Focus on the mark: `"error": "no mark or terrain feature
//   'wright/the-flip-day-plumb-line'"`. `world_investigate`: the same sentence.
//   … The escrow shadow: `escrow: 1` … The stake is real and the door can name
//   the mark when it is talking about stamps.
//
// The world here is a REAL git fixture clone, built the way
// `world-investigate-image.test.mjs` builds one and for the same reason: the
// door reads published state out of git and materialises the ENGINE out of the
// clone at main, so a plain directory would not do and a stand-in engine would
// be testing the stand-in.

// ── TERRAIN IS NOT A MARK, AND IT WAS NEVER MISSING ────────────────────────
//
// Repaired 2026-09-07 on the reviewer's finding. `investigate` answers a
// TERRAIN feature with `{ id, kind: "terrain", body, attaches }` and no `error`
// — a perfectly good answer about a real thing in the world. Commit 2's
// unconditional `return { ...r, receipt }` hung a receipt on it, and the
// receipt is derived from `claims` + canon MARKS, neither of which has ever
// held a terrain feature. So the town's own river came back beside
// `status: "never-was"`, "the record holds no mark of this id" — the exact
// mislabel class commit 4 fixed one door over, newly introduced by commit 2.
//
// THE ID IS READ OUT OF `WORLD/skeleton.json § features`, never typed here, so
// this leg cannot go vacuous the day the terrain is renamed: a hardcoded id
// that stopped resolving would answer `never-was` and the assertion would pass
// for the wrong reason. The red control below is what makes that safe.
