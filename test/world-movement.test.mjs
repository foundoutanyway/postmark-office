// world-movement.test.mjs — Stage D under THE FRAME LAW (ruled 2026-08-10).
//
//   node --test test/world-movement.test.mjs
//
// The falsifiers, one per sentence the cutover claims:
//
//   1. flag-off changes nothing               — the whole module is unreachable
//   2. a carrier is CLASS-DECLARED            — nothing here knows the word "boat"
//   3. the carrier runs on her timetable      — position = f(timetable, clock)
//   4. a walk never boards                    — the quay beside her (POS-247)
//   5. carriage is nothing happening          — no test since POS-247 (below)
//   6. hearing composes through the frame     — and needed no change to do it
//   7. the contract is shown at the boundary  — terms before the step
//   8. the freeze is a change of pen          — and refuses to be a change of place
//
// WHAT REPLACED WHAT. An earlier build asked residents to declare "I am aboard"
// and validated the claim against where they stood at the cast-off instant.
// Every test of that ceremony is gone, and the outcomes those tests protected
// are re-proved here in frame terms — most visibly `pass-through-doesn't-board`,
// which is now "entered and left before she moved: no live edge, no carry". The
// protected outcome is identical; the reason it holds is simpler.

  // over, because no office store can hold a passenger agreement yet
  // (`declareAttachment` admits only cascade|detach; the boarding verb lands
  // with the vessel work). Restoring the old expectation would be
  // re-implementing the one thing the ruling forbids.
  //
