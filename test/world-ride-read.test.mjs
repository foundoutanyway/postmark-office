// world-ride-read.test.mjs — `world { read: "ride" }` (POS-169).
//
// ── WHAT EACH HALF OF THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT REACH ───────────────────────
//
// Said here rather than left for a reader to infer from which cases exist,
// because a suite whose arms are not all reachable will report the same green
// either way.
//
//   · THROUGH THE READ (`readDomainFor("ride", …)`) — the envelope's key, the
//     ashore arm, the no-standing-resident arm, and the pointer sentence. These
//     run end to end against a real world clone and touch nothing stubbed.
//
//   · THROUGH THE DECISION (`rideBlockFrom`) — the aboard arms: a standing
//     ride, a ride come due, a rider who declared nothing. These CANNOT be
//     reached through the read in a tree with no Postgres: `actsOfActor` reads
//     the store, `actsQuery` answers `null` for "the register was not asked",
//     and that lands as `[]`, so no standing ride can exist for the read to
//     find. Driving the decision directly is what lets those three arms fail.
//     The wiring between them is held by the source-shape pin at the bottom —
//     which is a weaker instrument than a run, and is named as one.
//
// The whole suite needs a world clone for the timetable (the same one
// `world-ride.test.mjs` needs, for the same reason: a hand-built service would
// be prettier inputs than the engine gives). It skips by name without one.
// Run: WORLD_CLONE=<a world checkout> node --test test/world-ride-read.test.mjs
