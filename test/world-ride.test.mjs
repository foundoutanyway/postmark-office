// world-ride.test.mjs — THE POST OFFICE AS A PORTAL (postmark-town/postmark#2986).
//
//   node --test test/world-ride.test.mjs
//
// Every test carries the VERBATIM ruling it asserts. Keemin ruled this in
// conversation on 2026-09-19 and the brief quotes him in order; a test that
// quoted the brief's paraphrase would guard the paraphrase.
//
// ── WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS A FIXTURE ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The world clone is REAL: the fold, `tools/enter-exit.mjs`, `tools/world-verbs.mjs`
// and `tools/vessel.mjs` are the ones this office deploys against, so a drift
// between the two repos reds here rather than in front of a resident.
//
// THE FIXTURE BECAME THE RECORD on 2026-09-19 at 18:31 EDT — world main
// `6625d737` (PR #113) plants `class: vehicle` on `the-town/the-post-office`,
// the `vehicle` and `ride` class marks, and the Snug mooring on the wheelhouse.
// `vehicleWorld()` below no longer patches anything: it FOLDS THE REAL WORKS
// with the world's own `tools/marks-fold.mjs`, so what these tests run against
// is the town's law rather than this lane's idea of it.
//
// ⚑ AND `WORLD/world-state.json` AT THAT SHA WAS STALE, which is why the fold
// is run here rather than the committed file read. The merged PR changed the
// Works SOURCE (`WORLD/marks/**/mark.md`) and the fold is regenerated at the
// settlement, so at `6625d737` the committed fold still carried the pre-PR
// marks: no `class:` on her, three stops, no `ride` mark.
//
// ⚑ AND THAT STALENESS EXPIRED. The settlement caught the committed fold up at
// world `54a437a7` (2026-09-20), `class: vehicle` landed in the file, and the
// six legs whose control was `plainWorld()` went red — and stayed red on the
// train until POS-191. The control is now DERIVED rather than read; see
// `plainWorld()` below. Nothing in the office regressed and nothing the tests
// assert about the office changed: a record this suite treated as a fixture
// moved, which is what a record does.
//
// ⚑ AND THE STOP LIST IS FOUR, NOT FIVE. Folded off `6625d737`: the wheelhouse
// names `the-town/the-post-office` (her own berth), the Pando landing, the
// Garrison's grove wharf and the Snug mooring. Vermillion's landing and the
// brass-otter mooring are places residents have WALKED to, which is a different
// fact.
//
// ⚑ AND THE FOURTH STOP IS THE JETTY NOW (POS-487). The wheelhouse's timetable
// has named `current-the-reader/the-snug-jetty` since 2026-09-24 (Keemin's
// ruling, the world's own tools/vessel.test.mjs:76 records it: the story starts
// on the jetty); the mooring was the stop from 09-19. These thirteen tests kept
// the mooring and were the known reds since w41c (test/known-failures.json).

/** THE CONTROL every "the law gates the physics" leg needs: this same world
 *  with the vehicle class LIFTED, and nothing else changed.
 *
 *  ⚑ IT USED TO READ THE COMMITTED FOLD — `WORLD/world-state.json` — on the
 *  reasoning that at `6625d737` that file was still pre-PR (no `class:` on her)
 *  and so a real artifact rather than a hand-emptied copy. That reasoning had a
 *  clock in it. The committed fold is REGENERATED AT EVERY SETTLEMENT: world
 *  `54a437a7` (settlement sweep, 2026-09-20) swept `class: vehicle` into it,
 *  the control stopped being a pre-class world, and six legs of this file stood
 *  red from that crossing until POS-191. A live record pinned as a fixture
 *  decays with the next crossing.
 *
 *  So the control is now DEFINED by the one property it needs. `worldHasVehicle`
 *  (src/world-movement.mjs) gates on exactly this: a mark whose class is
 *  `vehicle` and which is not itself a class row. Clearing that predicate and
 *  nothing else is what makes these legs a control — one variable between the
 *  two worlds — rather than two unrelated folds compared. It cannot decay,
 *  because it is derived from whatever the world is today.
 *
 *  ⚑ AND THE CLASS HAS TWO FORMS NOW (LOGOS v2 part 2, W2). The world's kind
 *  migration writes her as `kind: vehicle` with no `class:` line, so deleting
 *  `class:` lifted nothing and six controls went red against a W2 world while
 *  CI's pinned world stayed green. The predicate is the office's own resolver
 *  (`markClassOf`, the one `worldHasVehicle` asks), and the lift undoes either
 *  form: the `class:` line goes, and a `kind: vehicle` stands back as the plain
 *  sited mark she was before the class was planted. */
