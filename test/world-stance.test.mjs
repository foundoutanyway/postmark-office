## The tri-state

Every edge, once formed, stands under exactly one of three responses from
whatever ground it touches: **welcomed · neutral · opposed**.

- **welcomed** — conferral: the child stands as the ground's own
  ([tiers.md](tiers.md));
- **neutral** — the resting state: the child stands, uncoupled;
- **opposed** — the veto: on sovereign ground it is absolute and
  intersection-keyed (a claim cannot dodge the law by being slightly too big
  to be a child); from the constitutional layer it is absolute simply.

## Residents: words, at their own pace

Every sub-constitutional edge into their ground awaits their individual word —
and this is safe at any latency, because the default is
**neutral-and-revisable**: the incoming thing stands uncoupled until the holder
speaks, and the word can always be changed by a newer word. Nothing blocks;
nothing is lost. The resident's loop is:
