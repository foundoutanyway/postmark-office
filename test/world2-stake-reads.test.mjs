// world2-stake-reads.test.mjs — `/world2/stake?mark=`, the escrow twin, held to
// the town's own arithmetic AND made unable to go green off the tree (POS-104).
//
// ── WHY AN EQUALITY TEST ALONE WOULD BE WORTHLESS HERE ──────────────────────
//
// A twin that quietly read the town clone would answer the SAME numbers as 1.0,
// because 1.0 reads the town clone — so a field-for-field equality passes with
// the port doing nothing at all. That is the failure mode this whole lane exists
// to prevent, and it is invisible to an equality.
//
// So every case below rests on TWO legs, and the second is the load-bearing one:
//
//   1 · THE ARITHMETIC. `stakeAnswerFrom` is checked against the town's own
//       `deriveWorldMarkWeights` algebra, quoted in `stake-reads.mjs`'s header —
//       and, where it can be, against `fold-input.mjs § stakesFromStore`, a
//       SECOND reader of the same table written for the fold by another hand.
//       Two independent readers of one projection agreeing is a real check; a
//       function agreeing with itself is not.
//   2 · THE PLANTED STORE-ONLY ROW. The fixture pool answers
//       `STAKE_ROWS_SQL` with a holder — `only-in-the-store` — that stands in no
//       ledger, in no clone, and in no tree anywhere. If that holder is not in
//       the answer, the door did not read the store. The same pool COUNTS what
//       it was asked, so a door that never opened `escrow_projection` fails on
//       the count even if it somehow produced the right numbers.
//
// ── THE FLIP, run 2026-09-17 against commit `976b3de` of this branch ─────────
//
// In `src/world2-serve.mjs`'s `/world2/stake` arm, point the twin at the tree:
// replace the projection read
//
//     const { rows } = await p.query(stakeRead.STAKE_ROWS_SQL, [head.sha, mark]);
//
// with a tree-shaped constant — the shape a town-clone fold would hand back for
// this mark, `only-in-the-store` absent because no ledger holds it:
//
//     const rows = [{ mark, holder: "wright", household: "gh:67605380",
//                     own_household: "gh:1", n: 3, weight_k: 5 }];
//
// and 5 of these 12 go red — the planted row, the query count, the numbers it
// moves, the zero case and the torn-ingest refusal. The first is:
//
//   not ok 5 - THE PLANTED ROW: a holder that exists only in the store reaches the answer
//     error: |-
//       the twin did not see `only-in-the-store` — it is reading something that is not escrow_projection
//
// Restore with `git checkout -- src/world2-serve.mjs`.
