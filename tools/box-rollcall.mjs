// box-rollcall — the roll-call of every mechanism that is supposed to be RUNNING.
//
// Built 2026-08-27 to close a failure class the town hit three times in one week,
// and the founder's sentence is the whole specification:
//
//     "A box roll-call exists: a manifest of every unit that must run with its
//      expected heartbeat, a checker that emits ALARM for missing or stale,
//      wired into my daily operator round … OPERATIONS.md carries the law: a
//      mechanism folds only with its runner, its liveness check, and its
//      activation owner named. 'Built' is not 'done.'"
//
// ── THE FAILURE CLASS, WITH ITS RECEIPTS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Machinery gets BUILT and never RUN, and nothing anywhere goes red. Four
// instances, all live on 2026-08-27 when this file was written:
//
//  1. THE WORLD DRAIN NEVER HAD A RUNNER (postmark#1990). The function existed,
//     was correct, was tested, and had no caller — marks aged 2+ days in a
//     journal nobody drained.
//  2. THE SETTLEMENT SHADOW IS DISABLED AND ITS VERDICT IS ROTTING.
//     postmark-settlement-shadow.timer is `disabled` on the box; the verdict on
//     disk at /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-shadow.json reads
//     {"at":"2026-08-24T22:23:00Z","status":"would-refuse"} — a WOULD-REFUSE, the
//     exact finding the shadow exists to raise — 2 days 8 hours old when it was
//     measured, and unread by anything the whole time. Its own script header says
//     the verdict is "polled by the ops page and
//     read on the operator round"; no step of the operator round reads it. That
//     sentence has been false since the day it was written.
//  3. THE ECONOMY REPORT'S TIMER IS OWED, and OPERATIONS.md § Known gaps has
//     said so since 2026-08-10 without anything alarming about it.
//  4. THE STRIPE WATCHER — this one is the CONTROL, and it is why PARKED is a
//     first-class verdict here. It was built 2026-08-25 and is not installed on
//     the box; that is correct and deliberate (its unit file says "STAGE B. NOT
//     INSTALLED, NOT ENABLED, INERT UNTIL ADOPTED"). A roll-call that simply
//     omitted it would make a deliberate parking indistinguishable from an
//     oversight — which is the same blindness one layer up.
//
// The one thing all four share: THERE WAS NO SURFACE ON WHICH THE ABSENCE OF A
// RUNNER WAS VISIBLE. Every other check in this repo asks whether a thing that
// ran produced the right answer. This one asks whether it ran at all.
//
// ── THE FOUR DESIGN RULES, EACH BOUGHT WITH A MEASUREMENT ───────────────────
//
// 1. A HEARTBEAT IS ONLY EVIDENCE OF A RUNNER IF THE RUNNER EXISTS AND IS
//    ENABLED. Measured on the box 2026-08-27: /srv/postmark-office/.stripe-watch-state.json
//    carried last_run 2026-08-27T04:04:34Z — four minutes fresh — while
//    postmark-stripe-watch.timer did not exist on the machine at all. A hand-run
//    wrote it. A checker that ranked freshness first would have called a rail
//    with no runner healthy, on the strength of a file a human touched. So the
//    unit is judged BEFORE the heartbeat, always, and a stale-looking heartbeat
//    on a dead unit reports the dead unit.
//
// 2. THE CADENCE COMES FROM `systemctl show`, NEVER FROM THE TIMER FILE. Measured
//    on the box 2026-08-27: /etc/systemd/system/postmark-dev-freshen.timer says
//    `OnCalendar=*:0/10` and even calls itself "every 10 minutes" in its own
//    Description — while the drop-in at .timer.d/nightly.conf clears that line and
//    substitutes `OnCalendar=*-*-* 08:10:00 UTC`. The effective cadence is DAILY.
//    A checker reading the file would have been wrong by a factor of 144 and would
//    have alarmed on a healthy rail every ten minutes forever. `systemctl show
//    -p TimersCalendar` returns the merged, effective value; that is the only
//    number this file will believe. (Sibling of the site-sentinel's own scar: its
//    stripe_watch probe once quoted a cadence the box did not run.)
//
// 3. A LIVE ROW THAT DECLARES NO STALENESS ALLOWANCE IS ITSELF AN ALARM. This is
//    instance 2 above, generalised. The shadow's verdict file has no field saying
//    when it goes off, so nothing on the box or in the repo could ever have said
//    it was old — it was served stale for sixty hours and every surface that
//    touched it reported exactly what it said. An un-allowanced heartbeat is not
//    a healthy heartbeat; it is a heartbeat nobody can check, and ALARM-unbounded
//    exists so that a lazily-written manifest row fails loudly instead of quietly
//    passing forever.
//
// 4. THE ROLL-CALL IS TWO-DIRECTIONAL. A manifest row with no unit is one failure
//    (something we swore would run, does not). A unit with no manifest row is the
//    OTHER failure, and it is the one that grows silently: every unit installed
//    after this file was written is invisible to the roll-call until someone adds
//    it. So the collector globs the box for every postmark-* timer, every
//    ENABLED postmark-* service, and every live instance of a template (the read
//    pool's, POS-522), and anything it finds that the manifest does not name is
//    ALARM-unmanifested. That is what keeps the roll-call from decaying into a
//    snapshot of 2026-08-27.
//
// ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It reads and reports. It never enables, disables, restarts, or writes a unit.
// Detection is mechanical here; the repair stays a hand — the same posture as
// harbor-watch and site-sentinel, and for the same reason (the 2026-08-19
// stranded-crossings incident is the town's receipt for an unwatched automatic
// hand).
//
// It also cannot see its own death, and NEITHER CAN IT SEE THE BOX'S. It runs on
// the box; if the box is down it does not run and therefore does not alarm. That
// is the classic watchman problem and it is NOT solved here — solving it needs an
// off-box heartbeat, which is a second machine. Named rather than papered over,
// because a roll-call that implies coverage it does not have is worse than none.
// What the wiring DOES give: the operator round runs it over ssh once a day, so a
// box that cannot be reached fails the ssh and the operator sees that instead.
//
// ── SHAPE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `collect()` is the only impure part: it shells out to systemctl and stat. Every
// judgment lives in `rollcall()`, which is a pure function of (manifest, snapshot,
// now) — so the falsifiers plant a healthy snapshot as a fixture, break exactly
// one thing, and watch exactly one row go red.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs                          # collect on the box, judge, print
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --snapshot snap.json     # judge a captured snapshot
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --dump-snapshot snap.json # collect, save, AND judge
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --json                   # machine-readable
// Exit: 0 = every row OK or PARKED · 1 = at least one ALARM · 2 = the roll-call
// itself could not run (no manifest, unreadable manifest, systemctl absent).

// ── ONE READER OF THE SETTLEMENT HISTORY (postmark#2979, 2026-09-21) ─────────
//
// deploy/settlement-history.mjs is the one law of the settlement log: it writes
// the lines, and it owns what they mean. This file used to keep its own copy of
// half of that — its own `UNSETTLED` status set and its own unfiltered window —
// so after postmark#2974 taught the crossing's 05:45Z escalation to ask its
// question of SCHEDULED lines only, the escalation and the board an operator
// reads at 8am could disagree about the same log. The one disagreeing by being
// WRONG was the board: a person publishing by hand between two refusals broke
// the run and silenced it, which is exactly the reading #2786 forbids — a
// person rescuing the town by hand is not the timer being healthy.
//
// THE EDGE IS SAFE BECAUSE BOTH DIRECTORIES SHIP FROM ONE TAG. The box runs
// this file as `$OFFICE/tools/box-rollcall.mjs` (deploy/box-rollcall.sh, with
// OFFICE=/srv/postmark-office) and runs the module below as
// `$OFFICE/deploy/settlement-history.mjs` (postmark-settlement.service, same
// root), and release-train.yml syncs every top-level directory the tag carries
// except telemetry/ and .github/ — so the two cannot be skewed by a release.
// A HAND-CARRY OF THIS FILE ALONE could still ship a reader older than what it
// imports; the hand-carry recipe in deploy/DEPLOY.md is where that is answered.

// a clock. Only ENABLED postmark-* services are in scope, because a `static`
// service is the body a timer triggers — it has no independent existence to
// roll-call, and listing all of them would double every row for no signal.
//
// ⚑ A TEMPLATE'S INSTANCES ARE NOT FILES (POS-522, postmark-office#354).
// `list-unit-files` lists unit FILES, so the read pool's template is one line,
// `postmark-office-read@.service`, however many instances run, and the instance
// names that a row can watch (`postmark-office-read@4391.service`) never appear
// there. Until 2026-10-09 a dead read worker raised no alarm in either
// direction. So the units systemd has LOADED and live (`list-units`: active,
// activating, failed) are read too, and every INSTANCE among them is in scope.
// A non-instance service there is a timer's body mid-run, or an enabled service
// the file listing already found, so it adds nothing but a flake. The template
// line itself is never a unit: `systemctl show` on it answers for no process.

// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-10, the arm gate). The 05:45Z crossing published
// green under release/2026-w37.9 and `escrow_projection` held ZERO rows after
// the same timer's clearing, because the candle — postmark-world2-clearing.service
// — runs clearing-job.mjs out of /srv/world2-lab/office, A SECOND OFFICE
// CHECKOUT at 7926461 (2026-09-05, schema <= 012, no escrow ingest) THAT THE
// RELEASE WORKFLOW NEVER DEPLOYS. Four units share that tree through
// deploy/world2-lib.sh's `WORLD2_OFFICE="${WORLD2_OFFICE:-$WORLD2_LAB/office}"`.
//
// EVERY ROW ON THE BOARD READ CORRECTLY AND THE BOARD WAS WRONG. The candle's
// row read OK because it reads the candle's TICK — the lane ran, on time, wrote
// its state file, and did old work. The notary's row read ALARM-outcome because
// the manifest (written from the new tree) declares an outcome log the OLD
// notary has no code to write. Neither row could say the word "tree", so the one
// fact that explained both was the one fact nothing on the box was holding.
//
// So this collects, for every unit the manifest names, THE TREE IT WILL
// ACTUALLY RUN, and the release stamp of that tree beside the deployed one.
//
// ⚑ THE SECRET. `systemctl show <unit> -p Environment` PRINTS THE MERGED
//   ENVIRONMENT, and on this box that includes
//   postmark-settlement.service.d/clearing-url.conf, whose WORLD2_CLEARING_URL
//   carries a Postgres password. The runbook's own rule is "never run
//   `systemctl show postmark-settlement.service -p Environment`", and a
//   collector that stuffed that string into a snapshot would be the same leak
//   with a file attached — `--dump-snapshot` writes to /tmp and the runbook
//   copies it OFF THE BOX. `pickEnv` is therefore a WHITELIST, applied at the
//   moment of reading: only the keys the manifest's tree rows name survive the
//   call, and the raw string is never stored, never returned and never logged.

// read as a quiet day for two days."

  // "silent when the field is absent" means a writer that stops emitting the list
  // turns its own alarm off. The judge says so instead.

  // noise. Appending it would hand the operator a ready-made excuse for the one
  // alarm that has no excuse, which is how a real finding gets skimmed past. I
  // wrote it the other way first and the end-to-end run on the box showed the
  // excuse attached to `lupi/the-drift-room`; this is that repair.
  // THE LIST RULE AND THE FLAG RULE BOTH SPEAK (lap 5, the lap-4 reviewer's

  // `canon_absent` carried a slug — prod's condition since window 177,
  // `lupi/the-drift-room` — the list alarm returned and `unchecked_means` never
  // printed: the operator was told about lupi and NOT told that the escrow half
  // of the read has never run. Repair 2 closed the day lupi settles; this closes
  // the days before it, which are the days between merge and that settlement.
  // The board's reason is one string that already carries a paragraph of
