// THE CREATURES (WLD-56 part 4; W5, Wright 10-14). A creature is a fold of the
// store's `acts` rows of class `creature`: the tick's (`the-town`: seed, spawn,
// fade, reveal) and the creature's own (`react`, and its `withdraw` when it
// flees, POS-637). The log carries every one of them whole, typed `creature`
// (the town's) or `creature-act` (the creature's own). The photograph is the
// world's own fold (`tools/creatures.mjs § creaturesSnapshot`): the newest
// photograph on disk from before this run, plus the rows since it, never the
// whole history. A creature's memory is never saved. No creature rows and no
// photograph to carry (before the launch dial) writes no creatures.json, so a
// save before the launch is byte for byte what it was.
//
// SNAPSHOT-AT-THE-BOUNDARY is the only reading under which snapshot and log
// compose: if the snapshot held save-instant state, replaying the crossing's own
// log over it would apply those events twice. The boundary is also the one
// instant a save and a later reader can both name without negotiating.
//
// TWO THINGS RIDE IN THE SNAPSHOT that a naive save would drop, and replay fails
// without either — the law states them as one sentence ("save the derivation's
// input alongside its output, and the instant it was evaluated"):
//
//   · the governing DEPARTURE RECORD, not just x,y. Position is derived, so a
//     snapshot of coordinates alone is a photograph of a moving thing: it cannot
//     be carried forward to any other instant.
//   · `evaluated_at`. Derived state without its clock is not state, it is a
//     number.
//
// CLOSING THE PREVIOUS CROSSING. A save fires a little after the boundary, so
// the log it last wrote for the outgoing crossing stops at the PREVIOUS save
// instant — leaving the minutes between that and the boundary in no file at all.
// Each run therefore also completes the crossing it just left, when that file is
// incomplete or missing. Every window is derived from its sources, so rewriting
// one is idempotent rather than additive.
//
// WHAT THE LOG CARRIES. Speech goes in whole — the words, the speaker, the
// place, the instant. That is the reading of "full-fidelity replay between any
// two crossings" and of the reason the record exists at all: people often find
// out only later what their agents were up to, and a record of bare timestamps
// could not tell them. It is also why the disclosure ships in this same commit.
// Keeping less than the words is a doctrine change for Keemin's pen, not a flag
// on this tool.
//
// NOT IN THIS SAVE, deliberately and said out loud in the file itself: VESSELS.
// Derived mobility crystallizes with the timetable work; until then the Post
// Office's position stays f(timetable, clock) and is absent from the snapshot
// rather than frozen into it at a stale coordinate.
//
// Deterministic: same store, same instant, same bytes. Nothing here reads a wall
// clock into the payload — every instant in the output is `--at` or derived from
// it, so a save run twice over an unchanged store commits nothing the second
// time.

  // retired twin into the clone, and it was one of the two pens that had to go.

  // from `tools/enter-exit-record.test.mjs` over there:
  //
  //     "the world repo has no journal to read — a longer derived file means a
  //      hand wrote in it"
  //
  // The committed file is the FROZEN ERA exactly, 155 act-lines, and it stays
  // that way. Every passage since the 2026-08-24 cutover lives in the office
  // journal, and the READ derives the live era on every request
  // (`servedEnterExitLedger`, the `/world/enter-exit-ledger` door, and the
  // viewer through it). Nothing is lost by not writing: the record the town
  // reads is complete, and it was complete before this line was deleted.
  //
  // What the emit actually did was bake live-era lines into the committed file
  // during passage activity, which put the world's grammar suite in the red —
  // and a red grammar suite costs the settlement sweep its isolation, which
  // refuses the whole crossing. Three hand-repairs on world main before both
  // pens were named. The other pen was `materializeLedgers` in
  // `src/world-drain.mjs`; it now filters these ledgers out explicitly.
  //
  // (World 2.0's database migration supersedes this seam. Until then the
  // passage record has exactly one writer, and it is the reader.)
  //
  // ── AND THE REPORT'S COUNT IS GONE TOO (G1 / POS-156, 2026-09-22) ────────
  //
  // What remained here was a READ: `enterExitLedgerText(CLONE, readJournal(db))`,
  // counted for the report so the operator could see the record moving. Its
  // source was the sqlite journal's frame rows, and G1 deletes the INSERT that
  // filled them — so the number it printed would be the FROZEN ERA's 155 lines
  // on every run for ever, a count that cannot move, reported as "the record
  // moving". A stale instrument is worse than none: it answers.
  //
  // It is deleted rather than re-pointed. The live era HAS a reader and it is
  // not this tool: POS-194 moved `servedEnterExitLedger` onto `acts`
  // (`enter-exit-ledger.mjs § livePassageRows`), and the
  // `/world/enter-exit-ledger` door and the viewer read it there. A second

  // question that already has an owner.
