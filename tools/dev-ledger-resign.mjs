// dev-ledger-resign.mjs — the dev town clone's stamp ledger, signed with DEV's
// own key (POS-354; Darko 2026-10-07: "yes" to a dev key).
//
// ── WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On 2026-10-07 the dev root's stamp key (/srv/postmark-office-dev/stamp-key.pem)
// was measured byte-identical to PROD's, and the dev office set no STAMP_KEY, so
// its pens defaulted to prod's key path anyway. A fresh dev key cannot simply be
// set: dev's town clone carries prod's tools/stamp-pubkey.pem and a ledger prod
// signed, so every line dev's pens append would fail the town's own verifier.
// This tool moves the dev clone onto dev's key, the stamp sandbox's way
// (tools/stamp-sandbox.mjs § resignTown): every signed line re-signed (the seals
// do not move: a seal is a hash of the text, the key only signs it), dev's public
// key installed, and the ruled exceptions the town names by signature carried to
// their new signatures. postmark-dev-freshen runs it every night, right after it
// stands the clone back on sandbox/seed.
//
// ── WHAT IT RUNS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node tools/dev-ledger-resign.mjs --town <dev town clone> --key <dev key pem>
//                                    --not-key <prod's key> [--verify]
//
//   --town     a dev clone only: every remote's push URL disabled, its real
//              path under /srv/postmark-office-dev or the temp dir (§ WHICH CLONE)
//
//   --not-key  (required) a key, public is enough (the freshen passes prod's
//              clone's tools/stamp-pubkey.pem): refuse when the key's public half
//              is this one's. Unreadable is a refusal. Independently, a key whose
//              public half is the seed's tools/stamp-pubkey.pem (prod's) is
//              refused with no prod path at all (§ NOT PROD'S KEY)
//   --verify   run the town's own verifier (tools/stamp-verify.mjs) on the result
//
// ONE COMMIT, THE SAME EVERY NIGHT. The re-sign is committed on the clone (never
// pushed) with a fixed author, committer and date (the seed commit's), and
// ed25519 signatures are deterministic, so the same seed under the same key is
// the same commit: anything keyed on the clone's sha, like the store's town-index
// head, still finds it after the next freshen. A clone already on the key (its
// public key is the key's, and every signed line verifies under it) is left alone.
//
// Exit 0 done (or already done) · 1 refused or red · 2 bad usage.
// Prints no secrets: the key is read into memory and never printed.
