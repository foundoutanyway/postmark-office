//
// THE ONE PARSER RULE. Every number on this page is a replay of the sealed
// stamp ledger through the TOWN's own tools/stamp-mint.mjs and
// tools/world-stake.mjs, imported live from the town clone and never vendored
// (the world-stake.mjs door pattern). This file computes no money grammar of
// its own — it does not regex the ledger, and if it needs a number the town
// does not already export, the fix is to export it there, not to parse here.
// world-report.mjs greps `stake:world-mark/` lines directly; that is the shape
// this deliberately does not copy.
//
// Sources:
//   1. town clone — WHITE_PAGES/stamp-ledger.md, replayed via stamp-mint.mjs
//      (foldMintCount = equity, foldBalances = liquid, foldStaked = escrow,
//      classifyEntry = issuance class) and world-stake.mjs
//      (deriveWorldMarkWeights = ledger_weight).
//   2. world clone — WORLD/world-state.json at origin/main, for the mark
//      register the escrow attaches to (tier, sovereignty, ids).
//
// VOCABULARY, and it is load-bearing. `ledger_weight` is the town's read-side
// derive: Σ open escrow + k × unique EXTERNAL staking households. It is NOT the
// world's ✦ — effective weight belongs to the world's fold, which adds terrain
// and the parent-consent fan-up on top. This page renders raw escrow and
// ledger_weight and says so; it never prints a ✦ it did not fold.
//
// Output: /var/www/postmark-ops/economy/index.html (+ data.json beside it).
// Zero dependencies. Node 20+. Rendering lives in tools/lib/ops-viz.mjs, shared
// with the other three dashboards and the hub.

The two chips below are the guards that can — a household below zero means the clip law was breached, and an account that moved stamps while never minting and never being pinned is money from nowhere.</p>
