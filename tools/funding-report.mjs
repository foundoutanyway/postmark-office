// funding-report — the whole funding state of the town, in one read.
//
// THIS IS STAGE A, and Stage A is the whole of what is meant to be adopted
// today. It is ONE COMMAND, read-only: no timer, no daemon, no unit, no stored
// state, nothing that can drift while nobody is looking. It reads Stripe live,
// the chain through whatever the existing watch last wrote, and the ledger
// through the town's own fold — then prints, for every payment it can resolve
// by rule, the exact one-line command that witnesses it.
//
// So the founder's work is: run one command, read one page, paste one line per
// payment. That is the whole of Stage A, and everything the timers in Stage B
// would automate is already decided HERE — the rules are the same functions.
// Stage B removes the paste, not the thinking.
//
// TURNING STAGE A OFF is not running it. There is no residue: it writes no
// state, installs nothing, and the town behaves exactly as it does today
// whether or not this file is ever executed.
//
// THE TEST THIS FILE IS BUILT AGAINST (the founder's, 2026-08-25): he should be
// able to read this in sixty seconds and have ZERO matching work — only vetoes.
// So the shape is: what needs a person FIRST, whether the machines are alive
// SECOND, and the books THIRD. A report that opened with the books would be a
// report you have to search for the thing that is wrong.
//
// It is a READ. No network, no key, no pen. Everything comes from three places
// that already exist:
//
//   the ledger   WHITE_PAGES/stamp-ledger.md, folded through src/funding.mjs —
//                the same fold the office's own funding reads use, so this
//                report and the doors can never disagree about a row.
//   the pots     WHITE_PAGES/pot-*.json, through the same reader, so a
//                malformed pot file is surfaced here by its own name.
//   the watchers the two rails' on-disk state and journals. usdc-watch writes a
//                report; stripe-watch writes an append-only intake journal, and
//                its unresolved rows are re-decided HERE by the same pure
//                function the watcher uses — never by a second copy of the rule.
//
// A DEAD WATCHER IS THE LOUDEST ANOMALY THERE IS, which is why the rails' health
// is above the books rather than in a footnote. Every other line in this report
// is a claim about money the town has SEEN; if a rail has not ticked, the town
// is not seeing, and the quiet queue is a lie rather than an all-clear. Same
// shape as usdc-watch's own refusal to report an empty day when it is blind.
//
