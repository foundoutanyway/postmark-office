//
// THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT IS NOT THIS TOOL. Dial 4 is ruled — at the movement
// cutover the ledger is frozen with honor: append stops, the file stays forever
// as the founding era's record, a PSA marks the seam, and `STATE/log/` becomes
// the movement record — but the pen that performs it is Keemin's, through
// Wright. This is the machinery that act runs, and it does nothing at all
// without `--apply`.
//
// What a freeze has to be true for, in order:
//
//   1. THE SEAM LINE. One line appended to `WORLD/walk-ledger.md`, in the
//      ledger's own voice, naming the instant and what takes over. It is the
//      last line the file will ever receive, and it says so.
//
//   2. NO WRITER REMAINS. Every codepath that can append to the ledger is
//      found and reported. A frozen file with a live writer is not frozen; it
//      is a file that has not been appended to YET, which is a different and
//      much worse thing to believe. The scan is the falsifier: it names the
//      writers and refuses while any of them can still run unflagged.
//
//   3. NOBODY MOVES ACROSS THE SEAM. The freeze changes the writer, never a
//      position. Every resident's derived position is computed on both sides —
//      the founding era's rules and Stage D's — and any resident the seam would
//      MOVE is named and the freeze REFUSES, because a constitutional act that
//      quietly teleports thirty residents is not a ceremony, it is an accident
//      with a commit message.
//
// THE THIRTY. Run against the town as it stands, check 3 fails, and the reason
// is worth stating because it is the finding this tool exists to surface. The
// 2026-08-09 return sailing was filed as ceremony lines: one walk-ledger line
// per passenger, `to the-town/the-post-office`, walking each of them onto the
// VESSEL'S OWN FOOTPRINT at the quay. Under the founding era's derivation that
// is harmless — nothing ever asked the timetable a question. Under Stage D it is
// not: standing inside her footprint at a cast-off is BOARDING (ENGINE.md, the
// first boarding rule), so the 18:00Z sailing collects all thirty and carries
// them back to Pando, and the next one brings them back, forever. The boat
// yo-yos the town.
//
// This is exactly the case ENGINE.md's SECOND boarding rule exists to prevent —
// "arrival sets you down ashore, OUTSIDE her footprint... without it, arrival
// deposits you exactly where the next departure collects" — and the ceremony pen
// simply did not apply it, because it was writing walks rather than deriving a
// ride. `--set-down-ashore` is the remedy in the rule's own words: at the seam,
// a resident whose last record leaves them standing inside a vessel's footprint
// is set down ashore beside her, exactly where the derivation would have put
// them had the ride been derived instead of written.
//
// It is OPT-IN and it is not this tool's decision to make. It restates thirty
// residents' positions, which is a doctrine call about the founding era's
// record, and the tool's job is to make the choice visible rather than to make
// it. Without the flag the freeze refuses and prints the list.
//
// TWO KEYS TURN AT ONCE, and the second one is not on the command line.
// `--apply` writes the seam line into whatever `WORLD/walk-ledger.md` the
// `--world` (or `WORLD_CLONE`) it was handed points at — and that env var is
// ordinarily set to the LIVE, SHARED world clone, because every other tool in
// this directory wants exactly that. So a single flag on a rehearsal command
// performs a constitutional act against the town's real record. (It did, the
// first time this tool was run; the write was reverted uncommitted, and this
// paragraph is what the receipt bought.)
//
// So the destructive half additionally requires `LEDGER_FREEZE=1` in the
// environment — the same shape as `TOWN_PUSH=1`, and for the same reason: the
// dangerous step should need a deliberate second sentence, in a different
// grammar, that no typo and no shell history can supply by accident. Every
// read-only path runs without it, which is the path a rehearsal wants anyway.
//
// Env: WORLD_CLONE, WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2 (the flag the freeze commits the town to),
//      LEDGER_FREEZE=1 (consent for --apply).

/**
 * Every resident's derived position under BOTH eras, at one instant.
 *
 * `before` is the founding era's arithmetic — `walk.positionAt`, the ledger
 * alone, no timetable consulted. `after` is Stage D's — `vessel.positionAt`,
 * the same record read with the schedule running. A resident whose two answers
 * differ is a resident the seam would move, and the freeze names them.
 *
 * ⚑ THIS SEAM IS AGREEMENT-BLIND, AND SILENTLY SO. The world's
 * `positionAt(departure, instant, service, agreements)` takes a fourth
 * argument; the call below passes three, and `main()` passes none either, so
 * the default empty list governs every read this instrument makes. Under the
 * agreement law (Keemin, 2026-08-11; world commit 64e66ed7, "boarding is
 * declared, never inferred") an empty list means NOBODY RIDES — so today this
 * function's "0 residents moved" is the true answer, because the office holds
 * no passenger agreements at all: `declareAttachment` admits only
 * cascade|detach, and the boarding verb lands with the vessel work.
 *
 * The day that verb ships, this stops being true and nothing here will say so.
 * The seam will keep reporting "0 residents moved" while residents are being
 * carried, and no test will red, because the blindness is in the call and not
 * in the arithmetic. BEFORE the boarding verb ships, `seamDiff` must take an
 * `agreementsOf` reader and pass its rows as the fourth argument — here and at
 * `main()`. The office test that guards this pins the refusal, not the carry:
 * see `the freeze names who the seam would move` in test/world-movement.test.mjs.
