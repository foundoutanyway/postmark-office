//        idea class's award acts from it, and nothing else. TOWN_PUSH=1 pulls
//        the clone first and pushes what lands; STAMP_LINES=store records the
//        landed lines in the store (stamp_lines) in the commit's transaction.
//
//   On the box, by hand, as the office user, with the office's env:

//   only where /usr/bin/flock exists (linux); off linux there is no lock at all,
//   and POST_AWARD_LOCKED=1 (the marker the locked child carries) skips taking it,
//   so never set it by hand.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS: THE AWARD RECORDS, A REVIEWED PASS WRITES (POS-290) ──────
//
// Darko, 2026-10-09: "Pay by hand: a hands-only act that awards stamps on a post
// to a credited resident with a label. It writes MINT → <who> · N · for:
// post:<id>/<label>, so every award is traceable. It runs as a list Wright
// reviews before it writes, and no formula mints by itself yet." The award act
// (src/idea-store.mjs § awardAtTown) records who, how many and why, and moves no
// stamps. This tool reads those acts, prints one row per award with the reason
// it pays or does not, and — only with --apply, only by hand — writes the
// town's line through its own `stamp-mint.mjs --award-mint`, once per owed row.
//
// THE AMOUNT IS THE ACT'S. Nothing here computes one: the row carries the act's
// `stamps`, the verb is handed that number, and the line says it.
//
// ── NEVER ON THE TICK ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is a fork of bug-stage-plan.mjs's shape, and unlike that pass it is never
// scheduled: deploy/office-keep.sh exports OFFICE_KEEP=1, systemd sets
// INVOCATION_ID for any unit it starts, and this tool refuses to run at all,
// plan or apply, while either is set. Wright runs it by hand.
//
// ── THE APPLY WRITES THE PLAN THAT WAS READ (Wright, 2026-10-09) ────────────
//
// The plan ends with a digest: sha256 over the exact lines it would write, in
// order. Beneath it is the one command that applies it, which carries
// `--expect <digest>`. --apply refuses unless --expect equals the digest of
// the plan it is about to write, with both digests shown. So an award recorded,
// a line paid or a date changed between the reading and the apply refuses the
// apply instead of slipping into it.
//
// ── WHAT DECIDES A ROW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   already paid   a `post:<id>/<label>` award line already in the town's
//                  ledger, read with the town's own classifier. One line per
//                  post and label, ever (the town's law), so it pays never again.
//   meep           the town's meep law (its ledger's `rules:` lines through its
//                  own meepChecker), at the act's date and at the line's: a meep
//                  never receives stamps, and the row pays 0.
//   unresolved     the recipient has no room in the town (the verb's own
//                  householdKeys read): an award needs a resident to receive it.
//   refused        the town's builder would refuse the line (a label that is a
//                  bug stage's name, more than AWARD_MAX, a `by:` that is not a
//                  hand), or a second award act names a (post, label) an earlier
//                  act already holds; the row carries the sentence and pays 0.
//   owed           everything else: the pass writes it.
//
// ── THE PARSE IS BOUND, AND SO IS THE AMOUNT ────────────────────────────────
//
// --apply prints the plan, parses its own printed plan back, and refuses the
// WHOLE apply, writing nothing, when the rows it parsed differ from the plan in
// any field (an amount, a recipient, a label, a hand, a count, the date). The
// money is minted from the plan's own rows, which the printed text has just been
// shown to equal.
//
// ── IT LANDS, WHOLE OR NOTHING, UNDER THE TOWN LOCK ─────────────────────────
//
// The bug stage pass only appends; the tick around it verifies, commits, pushes
// and records the lines in the store. A pass run by hand has no tick around it,
// so it lands on its own, the way a founder gift does (src/gift-exec.mjs):
// under the exclusive town flock the tick and the ferry take (on linux it
// re-runs itself under /usr/bin/flock), inside the pen's transaction, the
// town's verb once per owed row, the town's stamp-verify, then `landStamped`
// (with STAMP_LINES=store, `syncStampLinesVia`: insertStampRowsVia under
// lockStampLinesVia, in the store transaction around the commit and push). Any
// refusal on the way (a verb, the verifier, a push that cannot land) puts the
// ledger back as it stood, and nothing is written. It never catches the
// ledger up: a ledger behind the mail is the tick's to settle, and the verb's
// refusal says so.
