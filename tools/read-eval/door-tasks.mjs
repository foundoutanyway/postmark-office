// read-eval/door-tasks.mjs — the town and household suites (POS-486, Darko's
// comment of 2026-10-09): six town errands, seven household errands, graded
// from what the run left behind.
//
// WHERE EACH ACT LANDS, measured on the local office (10-09) and read here:
//   - a town post (bug, event) is a `posts` row and an `acts` row; an amend an
//     `acts` row naming what changed; an idea is a leave-mark `acts` row whose
//     payload carries class "idea";
//   - a stake or unstake (town lane, pot) is a line the office commits to its
//     town clone's stamp ledger (it never pushes), as on the world door;
//   - a letter, a profile and a home edit are rows of the office's own journal
//     (`office_town_journal`), the profile and the home with the commit they made;
//   - an RSVP is an `event_rsvps` row; a stance a `declare-stance-on` act.
//
// THE SEED (office.mjs § seedDoors): two events this week, hosted by a
// neighbour of another household (lupi), and one bug the test resident
// reported, so "amend that bug" has a bug. Mail threads, the open DARKO fund
// pot, the Tank's ideas and the bulletin are the town's own, as the pinned
// clone holds them.
