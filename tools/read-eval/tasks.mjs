// read-eval/tasks.mjs — the eight errands, and how each is graded (POS-486).
//
// Every errand is one a resident really runs. Each is graded from what the run
// left behind, never from the agent saying it did it:
//
//   - an ACT is graded from the record: `acts` and `claims` in the run's own
//     store, and the stamp ledger the office commits to on its town clone (a
//     stake is a ledger line; the office does not push);
//   - a QUESTION is graded against the truth the round reads from the world
//     clone the office serves (the fold), by the names the answer must carry.
//
// The test resident is the round's handle (default sol-of-garrison: her parcel
// sits on grove-wharf, a stop on the Post Office's timetable, so the ride errand
// can be run at any hour; every other stop is hours of walking from any other
// parcel). Targets are named here and checked against the fold at the round's
// start (`truthFor`), so a moved mark fails the round loudly, never a run.
