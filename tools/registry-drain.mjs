// registry-drain.mjs — the store -> the town's two files (POS-187).
//
// The household registry is store-of-record (019_households.sql). This is the
// drain that makes the town repo's two JSON files a RENDERING of it:
//
//   node tools/registry-drain.mjs --check    render, diff against the clone,
//                                            exit 0 on byte-equality or 1
//                                            naming the first differing line —
//                                            or the rows the store is MISSING
//   node tools/registry-drain.mjs --apply    write and commit both files
//                                            through the town pen, only when
//                                            they differ, and REFUSE rather
//                                            than shrink the registry
//   node tools/registry-drain.mjs --ingest-missing --reason "…"
//                                            adopt the rows the files hold and
//                                            the store does not, print each,
//                                            then drain naming them
//
// ── `--check` IS THE GATE, NOT A REPORT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// It answers exactly one question — does the store render today's real files,
// byte for byte — and it is the condition on every later step. Since POS-394
// the files are the PUBLIC render (`renderPublicRegistry`: each house's private
// `human` key left out; the store and the private render keep it), so the
// gate and the write below both use the public render, and a printout that
// still carries a `human` key is a differing line until the next drain. It runs at the
// crossing, before anything trusts the store, and its red is the whole flip
// stopping. The law it enforces is `src/registry-rows.mjs`'s header:
//
//     renderPublicRegistry(rowsFromRegistry(the files)) === the files   (POS-394: the printout is the public render)
//
// proven there against the 2026-09-22 fixtures, and proven HERE against
// whatever the clone holds this morning. The two are the same law read from
// the two ends: the test proves the fold and unfold compose, `--check` proves
// the STORE still holds what the fold put in it.
//
// ── `--apply` COMMITS THROUGH THE TOWN PEN AND NOTHING ELSE ─────────────────
//
// `penCommit` (src/write.mjs:43) — the one ceremony every office write to the
// town clone goes through: stage, commit as the office bot with the stable
// author string, push when `TOWN_PUSH=1`, and verify the commit is an ancestor
// of `origin/main` before calling it landed. It RETURNS NULL FOR AN EMPTY DIFF,
// so idempotence is not something this file implements — it is something the
// pen already guarantees, and a drain that re-rendered identical bytes commits
// nothing and says so.
//
// A second writer here would be the thing this whole lane exists to end. There
// is one pen and one pool: reads go through `actsQuery`'s pool
// (src/world2-acts.mjs), writes go through `penCommit`.
//
// ── `drainRegistry()` IS EXPORTED FOR POS-158 ───────────────────────────────
//
// The mint writes its house to the table and then calls this, in the same act,
// so the file never lags the row by a crossing. It takes an injected `commit`
// exactly as `declareHousehold` does, so a falsifier can prove the whole
// decision path without a clone or a pen.
//
// ── ENV ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   TOWN_CLONE      the town checkout the files are diffed against / written to
//   TOWN_PUSH=1     push the commit (penCommit's own gate)
//   BOT_NAME / BOT_EMAIL   the pen's author string
//   WORLD2_PG=1 + WORLD2_PG_URL    the office's record connection (office_api)
//
// Nothing is sourced and no secret is printed.

// ── THE DRAIN NEVER SHRINKS THE REGISTRY (POS-158, Keemin 2026-09-22) ───────
//
// THE HAZARD THIS CLOSES, exactly. `renderPublicRegistry` renders the WHOLE registry
// from the table and `--apply` writes it over the town's file. So a house that
// stands in the FILE and not in the TABLE is DELETED by the next drain — and
// there is a road that produces exactly that state: the town's witness rule 2b
// still lets a bound resident edit their own row in a hand PR, and until that
// flips (a TOWN PR, at the ship, not this lane's) a merge can put a house in
// the file that no office door ever minted.
//
// POS-187 stopped one course below this wall; the office's own writers all
// close in this lane's PR, and this is the guard that makes the last road safe.
// It is the same failure `src/registry-store.mjs:36-44` warns about — "a
// reader switched to the store today would read a table frozen at its seed,
// fold over it, and commit a file that DROPS every house declared since" —
// arriving from the write side instead of the read side.
//
// SO THE DRAIN REFUSES RATHER THAN RENDERS. If the file holds a house or a pin
// the table lacks, nothing is written and nothing is committed, and the refusal
// NAMES each missing row so a person can act on it. A drain that shrank the
// registry by one row and said "byte-equal" afterwards is the one outcome this
// whole lane exists to make impossible.
//
// The repair is a DOOR, not a silent fold: `--ingest-missing --reason "…"`
// below, which upserts the file-only rows into the table, prints each, and
// names them in the commit. Adopting them silently inside the drain would make
// the drain a second writer with no receipt, which is the thing POS-187's
// header calls "the thing this whole lane exists to end".
//
