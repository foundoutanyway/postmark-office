// ── THE SUBJECT IS A gh_id, AND THE TOOL WILL NOT GUESS ONE ────────────────
//
// Rows key on the immutable GitHub account id (src/roles.mjs says why at
// length). An operator thinks in names, so `--subject` accepts either and
// RESOLVES a name to an id before writing. It resolves from two sources, both
// read-only:
//
//   1. the town clone's `tools/github-ids.json` — records are keyed by town
//      HANDLE and each carries `{ login, id }`, so a login is found by scanning
//      values. One login may appear under several handles (`alden` and `corwin`
//      are both `fox-hearth`, id 20786448); that is one household with two
//      handles and resolves fine. If two records disagree on the id, the tool
//      REFUSES rather than pick.
//   2. `oauth.db`'s `tokens` table (`gh_login` -> `gh_id`) — anyone who has
//      ever signed in.
//
// If neither resolves it, the tool REFUSES and tells the operator to pass
// `--gh-id`. It does not store the string hopefully. A registry that accepted
// an unresolvable name would be storing a typo that silently grants nobody
// anything, and the operator would have no way to see that from `list` — the
// row would look exactly like a working one.
//
// HAND-KEPT IS THE WORKFLOW, not a stopgap to apologise for. v0 of the
// subscription lane is a single whitelist an operator maintains — they run this
// locally against a copy, or they ssh to the box and run it against the live
// file. There is no self-serve path, no webhook, no door that writes here, and
// that is the point: while the list is short, a human deciding each line is
// cheaper and far more legible than machinery, and every line carries who
// decided it.
//
// ── WHO RAN THIS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every act names an actor and the audit row keeps it. `--actor` is explicit;
// absent it, the tool takes the OS username, and absent THAT it refuses rather
// than write `unknown` into a book whose entire job is accountability. An audit
// trail whose actor column says "unknown" is a state with no receipt wearing
// the costume of one.
//
// ── LIST SHOWS THE TRAIL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `list` prints the standing AND the audit beneath it, because the two answer
// different questions and an operator at a terminal almost always has the
// second one. The standing says who may pass right now; the trail says how each
// of them got there, and — the half only the trail can answer — who USED to
// pass and does not any more. A revoked household vanishes from the first list
// entirely; if `list` only printed standing, the most interesting fact the
// registry holds would be invisible from the operator's only view of it.
//
// ── WHICH BOOK (POS-271) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// With OFFICE_PAPERWORK_STORE=1 and the store's WORLD2_PG / WORLD2_PG_URL in
// this shell, the tool writes the store's office_roles (and --db's file after
// it, as the office's own mirror does). Without them it writes the file only.
// An office switched to the store reads only the store, so a grant written to
// the file alone would grant nobody: every run prints which book it wrote, on
// its first line, so the operator sees that before anything else.
