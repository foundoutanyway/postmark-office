// site-sentinel — the loud eye on whether the town is UP and whether it is FRESH.
//
// Built 2026-08-25, the day the site's half-hourly "Sync Postmark atlas" ran red
// on every tick for a full day while its sibling "Deploy" stayed green beside it,
// and nobody was told. The founder's sentence is the whole specification:
//
//     "how can we LOUDLY BE NOTIFIED when something is down on the site?"
//
// The answer this file gives is a posture, not a feature: WATCH THE OUTCOMES,
// NOT THE PIPELINES. A pipeline probe can only catch the failures someone
// already imagined and wired a check for. An outcome probe — is the page
// answering, is the served bytes the current bytes — catches causes nobody
// predicted, including the ones that have not been invented yet. The workflow
// probe is here too (§5), but deliberately last and deliberately framed as a
// SECOND opinion: a red pipeline beside a green outcome is a finding, and a
// green pipeline beside a red outcome is a lie.
//
// Posture, borrowed verbatim from harbor-watch.mjs because it is the same
// posture: "This script only reads and reports — it never writes to any world."
// It writes to no clone (§8 READS the office's town clone, with git's optional
// locks off), holds no pen, takes no lock. Its only writes are its own
// state file, its own status board, and an HTTP POST to a Discord webhook.
//
// ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, AND WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not restart anything, redeploy anything, or re-run a workflow. A
// watcher that acts on its own reading is a watcher whose reading nobody checks;
// the 2026-08-19 stranded-crossings incident is the town's own receipt for what
// an unwatched automatic hand costs. Detection is mechanical here; the repair
// stays a hand.
//
// It also cannot see its own death. If the box is down, or the timer is masked,
// this file does not run and therefore does not alarm — the classic watchman
// problem, and it is NOT solved here. Solving it needs an off-box heartbeat
// (a dead-man's switch someone else pings), which is a second machine and
// outside this lane. Named rather than papered over, because a sentinel that
// implies coverage it does not have is worse than no sentinel.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THAT MADE THE DESIGN, ALL MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ────────
//
// 1. GitHub's UNAUTHENTICATED REST budget is 60/hour per IP, and a conditional
//    request that returns 304 STILL SPENDS ONE. Measured 2026-08-25 against the
//    live API: X-RateLimit-Used went 4 -> 5 across a request that answered
//    "304 Not Modified". So ETags buy bandwidth, not budget. This watch
//    therefore spends at most TWO REST calls per tick (12/hour at the 10-minute
//    cadence, a fifth of the budget, leaving room for whatever else on the box
//    shares the address): one combined /actions/runs read for every workflow at
//    once, and one commits?path= read for the daily's source. Every commit SHA
//    it needs comes from `git ls-remote`, which is the git wire protocol and
//    spends no REST budget at all. (§11 adds one compare call per NEW sweep-
//    and-tag pair, remembered in its state, so a few a day, never one a tick.)
//    §13, the Linear handler, reads ONLY WITH THE TOKEN (POS-631, W4): one runs
//    read per handler repo, six a tick, and one more repo read every tick for
//    each repo whose workflow 404s (a caller not yet on its default branch, or
//    a repo the token cannot see): 6 to 12 a tick, 36 to 72 an hour, against
//    the token's 5,000. Plus a jobs and an annotations read once per NEW
//    failed run, remembered in its state. Keyless, it spends nothing and its
//    rows read UNKNOWN, so the two reads above keep the anonymous 60.
//
// 2. PROD DOES NOT BUILD FROM MAIN, so "deployed sha vs main tip" is not a
//    staleness test — it is a permanent false alarm. deploy.yml's release lane
//    checks out the newest `release/*` tag and builds the CODE from there, then
//    overlays the town DATA from main (`git checkout origin/main -- ...`).
//    Prod lagging main on code is the design. Which is why the stamp this
//    watch reads carries TWO shas and the watch compares each against its own
//    reference: code against the release tag, town data against main.
//
// 3. THE 08-24 FREEZE IS THE PROOF THAT THE SECOND HALF MATTERS. deploy.yml's
//    own comment records it: "prod served Crossing 144 while main carried 146"
//    — the code was correctly pinned and the content was silently frozen behind
//    it. A one-sha stamp cannot express that failure. A two-sha stamp makes it
//    the first thing you see.
//
// ── THE PROBES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. UP        — the public doors answer 200. Cheapest API door is GET /api/,
//                 the capability manifest: static, public, no DB work, and it
//                 carries X-Postmark-As-Of, so probe 3 rides along on it for
//                 free. dev.postmark.town is INFO-only: it sits behind
//                 Cloudflare Access and a 302 to *.cloudflareaccess.com is its
//                 HEALTHY shape, so alarming on it would train the reader to
//                 ignore the channel.
//  2. FRESH/SITE — /build.json's code_sha vs the newest release/* tag, and its
//                 town_data_sha vs site main's tip. Time-anchored (below).
// 2b. FRESH/CROSSING — /build.json's `crossing` vs the office's own crossing
//                 number at GET /api/. THE EVENT-SHAPED QUESTION, added
//                 2026-08-26 with the box refresh timer: mail moves at
//                 crossings, not on a wall clock, so "has a ferry landed since
//                 this page was built" is a question no duration threshold can
//                 answer. Costs zero extra requests — it reads the body of the
//                 manifest probe 1 already opens. Probe 2 stays as the floor.
//  3. FRESH/DATA — the served X-Postmark-As-Of vs the town repo's main tip.
//                 This is the probe that would have caught the stuck rehydrate
//                 tick found BY HAND on 2026-08-25 (one distinct as-of across
//                 40 minutes and three scheduled tick slots).
//  4. FRESH/DAILY— the served /daily/ferrys-daily.html actually contains the
//                 current TOWN_BULLETIN/ferrys-daily.md's headline. Note the
//                 path: /daily/ is a WRAPPER page that links to the daily and
//                 does not inline its prose, so probing /daily/ for the daily's
//                 text answers a question nobody asked.
//  5. WORKFLOWS  — the latest run per workflow on main that actually DECIDED
//                 something. Cancellations are looked through, never counted as
//                 health: these two workflows cancel each other by concurrency
//                 group all day, and the first version of this probe called that
//                 green and reported the 08-25 fire itself as fine.
//  8. CLONES     — the office's town clone has no uncommitted tracked files
//                 and is not off the town's main past one tick. Dirt is DOWN:
//                 every write that pulls the clone refuses while it stands
//                 (2026-09-28, 4.5 hours, found by a resident). The reader is
//                 tools/clone-state.mjs, shared with the box roll-call.
//  9. DISK      — the box's root disk is under 85% used. The ground: on
//                 2026-10-09 a full disk took Postgres, sign-in and the ferry
//                 down two hours before anyone looked. This probe replaced
//                 postmark-disk-watch, which shouted into the same channel on its
//                 own timer (POS-556, Darko 2026-10-10: ONE route to the Meepo
//                 bot, the one /fleet also reads).
// 10. MEEPS     — the town's meeps on Letta are answering. Read from
//                 /srv/postmark-sentinel/meeps.json, the record Wright's watcher
//                 (G:/Wright-HQ/tools/meep-watch.mjs, on Darko's desktop, every 5
//                 min) lands here by scp. A meep that is down, stuck, cut off,
//                 missed a round or failed one is DOWN; a record older than 15
//                 min, or none at all, is STALE: the watcher or the desktop has
//                 stopped, and a silent watcher must not read as healthy meeps
//                 (Darko 2026-10-10 13:27, POS-556).
// 11. SETTLEMENT — the newest sweep receipt (/srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-
//                 auto.json) settled within the hour: a publishing sweep whose
//                 world the newest settlement/S<n> tag covers, peeled, by
//                 equality or descent; a quiet sweep with no unblessed sweep
//                 publication between that tag and its world. A refusal, a
//                 publication no tag covers, or a
//                 06:00/18:00 slot with no receipt, an hour on, is DOWN (Darko
//                 2026-10-11: "it needs to bark"), and so is an unreadable
//                 receipt; a blessing that cannot be verified an hour on is
//                 STALE — past the hour, never silent. Tags over ls-remote; descent
//                 by ONE remembered compare call per new (world, tag) pair.
// 12. LAW PEN   — the law pen's state (/srv/world2-lab/state/ingest-law.json)
//                 reads `ok` within 45 min. A law the parser would read
//                 diminished is refused WHOLE (POS-619), which holds every law
//                 update until the mark is fixed, so a refusal is DOWN with the
//                 lint's sentence as its reason; a held pin (law-pin-held,
//                 POS-628) is DOWN with the pin it stays at; any other failed run is DOWN;
//                 none, unreadable or older than 45 min is STALE.
// 13. LINEAR HANDLER — one row per repo that carries the Starforge Linear
//                 handler's caller: its newest decisive run either succeeded,
//                 or failed only on its `done line` (the PR author's to fix),
//                 or it is DOWN, naming the repo, the run and the failed job's
//                 annotation. No run yet is INFO; a repo the token cannot see
//                 (postmark-telemetry is private) is UNKNOWN (POS-631).
//
// ── ONE ALARM ROUTE (POS-556) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file is the only thing on the box that posts an alarm to Discord, and
// /ops/sentinel.json (this file's --out board) is what Wright's /fleet reads.
// Discord and /fleet hear the same thing because they read one record. A new
// box alarm is a probe here, never a script with its own webhook call. The
// one alarm that cannot be a probe is the watch on this file's own death,
// which runs off the box (the town's .github/workflows/offbox-watch.yml) and
// reads this same board's generated_at.
//
// ── THE STALENESS CLOCK, AND WHY IT IS ANCHORED WHERE IT IS ─────────────────
//
// Every freshness probe compares a SERVED value against a REFERENCE value, and
// the naive rule ("alarm when they differ") is wrong twice over: it fires during
// the ordinary minutes between a push and its deploy, and — subtler — anchoring
// the clock to the PAIR means a repo that commits every 30 minutes resets the
// clock every 30 minutes and can never accumulate an alarm even while every
// deploy fails.
//
// So the clock is anchored to the DIVERGENCE: how long has the reference been
// somewhere the served value is not? It starts the moment the two first differ,
// PERSISTS while the reference keeps moving (a busy repo cannot hide a frozen
// site — the original anchoring law, kept), and clears the moment they agree
// or the served value advances (a progressing pipeline is never stale).
//
// HISTORY, because the previous anchor rang 6-7 false alarms a day and its
// header note claimed it couldn't (found 2026-08-31, Keemin's challenge): the
// clock used to be anchored to the SERVED value alone — "how long has the site
// answered with THIS value" — on the argument that a quiet repo never alarms
// since served equals reference. True while quiet; false at the first commit
// AFTER the quiet: the town sat unchanged for 59 minutes (01:32-02:31Z, an
// ordinary quiet hour), one stake landed, and nine minutes later the sentinel
// declared 49 minutes of staleness — the age of a perfectly current serve of a
// perfectly quiet repo. Serving an old sha of a repo that hasn't moved is
// health; only trailing a KNOWN-NEWER reference is staleness, and the clock
// now measures exactly that.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/site-sentinel.mjs [--state <state.json>] [--out <status.json>]
//                                [--json] [--dry-run] [--now <iso>]

/**
 * Is the site showing the CURRENT ferry crossing?
 *
 * WHY A WALL-CLOCK THRESHOLD IS NOT ENOUGH, which is this probe's whole reason
 * to exist. Every other freshness probe here asks "how long has the served value
 * been frozen?" — a duration question. But mail does not move on a duration; it
 * moves at crossings, 00:00 and 12:00 UTC, and everything a resident cares about
 * changes in that one instant. A three-hour threshold measured from whenever the
 * site last happened to change cannot see that: on 2026-08-26 the site had
 * rebuilt recently enough to look healthy by the clock while the ferry that had
 * landed 97 minutes earlier was nowhere on it, and 48 doorstep pages served
 * yesterday's mail. The freshness architecture names the repair directly:
 * "a wall-clock threshold cannot see an event-shaped failure."
 *
 * So this asks the event question instead: the site's build stamp carries the
 * crossing it was baked at, the office serves the crossing it is now, and the
 * gap between them is either zero or a finding. The wall-clock probes stay
 * exactly as they were — they are the floor under this, and they catch the
 * failures that have nothing to do with crossings.
 *
 * NO MEMORY. Every other freshness probe needs a `seen` record because it cannot
 * know when its reference moved. This one can: a crossing is a pure function of
 * time (src/crossings.mjs — 12h since 2026-06-12), so "how long has crossing N
 * been the current one?" is arithmetic, not history. That is worth saying out
 * loud, because a probe with no state cannot be wrong about its own past.

//
// Every other freshness probe here asks "is the site CURRENT?". This one asks
// a question none of them can: the site is current, and something inside it is
// not. On 2026-09-21 the town shed a bulletin entry, the entry door 404'd, and
// the site build refused to publish at all — every page on postmark.town froze
// for thirty minutes over one deleted entry. POS-166 and POS-180 make that a
// DROP instead of an outage: the build publishes, the shed thing leaves, a
// 404'd resident keeps the row they had, and the build writes down what it
// could not get.
//
// The founder's ruling is the whole design of this probe: "We just need to know
// this happened, not block things on it." A drop that nothing can see is not a
// fix, it is a silence — and until this probe existed, `problems` was assembled
// by the site's fetch and written only to a build log nobody reads on a
// schedule. This is the half that makes the drop safe.
//
// WHY STALE AND NOT DOWN. The site is up, fresh, and serving. What is wrong is
// that one row in it is held over from an earlier build, or one entry the town
// still names is missing. DOWN would say the site is unreachable, which is
// false, and a probe that cries outage over a shed handle is the alarm a reader
// learns to ignore. STALE is already this file's word for "what is served is
// behind what it should be", it is already in BAD so it alarms and reminds, and
// it is the true sentence here. No new severity is invented for it.
//
// FOUR STATES, AND THE DEPLOY-ORDER TRAP IS THE THIRD ONE.
//   a list with rows  the build published and could not get these things.
//   an empty list     the build asked for everything and got it.
//   `problems: null`  a POS-180 stamper that could not read its own manifest.
//                     Unread, never clean — UNKNOWN, the same way every other
//                     null on that stamp is read.
//   NO KEY AT ALL     an older stamper. This is not a fault and MUST NOT red:
//                     the two repos deploy independently, so between the office
//                     shipping this probe and the site shipping the field,
//                     every build.json prod serves is keyless. A probe that
//                     alarmed there would page the founder for the duration of
//                     an ordinary rollout, about a site that is working. INFO
//                     is this file's existing word for a probe that is counted,

// ── §13 the Linear handler: did its last finished run act? ───────────────────
//
// The Starforge Linear handler (keeminlee/starforge-linear-handler) is the only
// automatic mover of Linear states. Each caller repo runs it as
// .github/workflows/linear-handler.yml on pull_request_target, and the job has
// two steps of ours: `linear` (acts on Linear; it fails only when the handler
// could not act) and `done line` (fails when the PR's done line needs fixing:
// the author's to fix, never an alarm). If its runs fail, issues silently stop
// moving, so a failure is a probe here (POS-631; the shape is Jetto's, 10-14).
//
// THE RULE (Wright, 10-14, G1): DOWN when the newest DECISIVE run did not
// succeed and its `linear` step is not `success`. That counts a checkout that
// failed first (linear skipped), a startup_failure (no jobs at all) and a
// timeout: in each one the handler did not act. A `done line` failure after a
// successful `linear` is OK, and says so.
//
// WHAT IT LEARNED FROM THE LIVE RUNS (10-14):
//   - A `done line` failure makes the whole run's conclusion `failure`, so the
//     conclusion alone cannot tell the steps apart. A run that SUCCEEDED does
//     prove `linear` did (neither step is continue-on-error), so the jobs are
//     read only for a run that did not succeed.
//   - Cancellations are looked through (INDECISIVE, §5's law): the caller's
//     concurrency group still cancels a superseded pending run, and a cancelled
//     newest run must not hide the failure beneath it.
//   - The job summary, where the handler writes why it failed, has no REST read
//     (the check run's output.summary is null). The reason comes from the failed
//     job's annotations instead, past GitHub's generic "Process completed with
//     exit code N"; the run URL is always there.
//   - 404 is two answers: the workflow has no run yet (its caller is not on the
//     repo's default branch, which is where pull_request_target reads it), or
//     the token cannot see a private repo (postmark-telemetry). One read of the
//     repo itself tells them apart: the first is INFO, the second UNKNOWN.
//
// PURE: the caller reads GitHub, so every branch is falsifiable offline.

// ── §11 the settlement: the sweep and its blessing ──────────────────────────
//
// THE RULING (Darko, 2026-10-11): "If the settlement that we expect has not
// gone through an hour after its expected time … it needs to bark." A blocked
// settlement is the town's top priority, and this file is the ONE alarm route,
// so the bark is a probe here.
//
// THE INSTANCES. The 2026-10-10T18:00Z sweep published world 33306f30 and no
// settlement tag covered it until S102 (on 0cca7f2b, a descendant) at about
// 06:38Z the next morning — twelve hours with nothing ringing. The
// 2026-10-11T18:00Z sweep published 5d878f3c and was held: an hour later the
// newest tag was still S102. The roll-call's ALARM-unblessed (tools/box-
// rollcall.mjs) asks a different question — how OLD is the newest tag — on the
// operator round's clock; this asks the per-sweep question on the sentinel's
// ten-minute one: did THE sweep we expected settle within the hour?
//
// WHAT "SETTLED" MEANS. The box's sweep (deploy/settlement-auto.sh, 06:00 and
// 18:00 UTC, postmark-settlement.timer) writes ONE receipt, overwritten each
// run, at /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-auto.json. The keeper's blessing is
// an annotated tag `settlement/S<N>` on postmark-world, normally cut by ~:40.
// A later tag covers every earlier sweep, so only the NEWEST receipt and the
// NEWEST tag (by number, never by text: S10 sorts before S9) matter, and the
// sweep is settled when that tag's peeled commit IS the receipt's world_to or
// descends from it.
//
// THE STATUSES are settlement-auto.sh's own `report` words: `published` and
// `quiet` are the clean ones; `refused`, `race` and `starving` are
// deploy/settlement-history.mjs's UNSETTLED set. A status this probe does not
// know is NOT read as clean — the same law as classifySiteRefresh's, but louder,
// because "nothing settled" is the ruling's whole question and an unknown word
// cannot answer it yes.
//
// A QUIET SWEEP ASKS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. The keeper tags PUBLICATIONS — S80
// to S103 are every one a `settlement: sweep N published, …` commit (plus the
// by-hand S93) — and never a quiet crossing. And main always moves between
// sweeps: the Pen's crossing-save (~00:05Z / 12:04Z), merged PRs, the sweep's
// own "household registry re-derived" commit. So a quiet sweep's world_to is
// almost never a tagged commit, it is a DESCENDANT of the newest tag, and
// asking "does a tag cover it" would page on every quiet sweep. (The first
// version of this probe did, and its quiet test hid it behind a fixture whose
// world was the tag's own commit — a state postmark-world never reaches.)
//
// The quiet question is: between the newest tag and the world this sweep
// stands on, is there a PUBLICATION nobody blessed? GitHub's compare, base =
// the tag, head = world_to, lists that range (up to 250 commits); a commit
// whose subject is `settlement: sweep …` with a nonzero count is a held
// publication. None there: OK. One there: DOWN past the hour, exactly as for
// the publishing sweep itself — a quiet morning must not clear a held night.
// A range longer than GitHub lists, or no answer, is unread: STALE past the
// hour. judgeQuietRange below is that reading, pure.
//
// THE CLOCK runs from the receipt's own `at` (the run's start stamp). Sixty
// minutes is the keeper's ~:40 plus slack, and it is the ruling's number. Inside
// it a held sweep is OK ("awaiting the blessing"); past it, DOWN. DOWN and not
// STALE: the town is not behind, it is blocked, and the repair is a person
// (postmark-telemetry docs/SHIPPING.md § 9: ours to unblock, never the keeper's).
//
// PAST THE HOUR, SILENCE IS NOT POSSIBLE (coordinator, 2026-10-11). UNKNOWN
// never alerts here and /fleet barks only on DOWN or STALE, so an unread input
// that stayed UNKNOWN would let a blocked settlement sit silent for as long as
// the input stayed unread. Inside the hour, unread is UNKNOWN — this file's
// rule for an unread reference (classifyStamp, classifyDisk), and nothing is
// overdue yet. Past it:
//   - NO RECEIPT (missing, unreadable, unparseable, no `at`) is DOWN, the same
//     sentence as the MISSING SLOT: a readable receipt whose `at` is older than
//     a slot an hour gone means the slot did not run, did not finish, or died
//     before writing — "the settlement we expect has not gone through" — and a
//     receipt nobody can read is no evidence that it did.
//   - A SWEEP WE CANNOT VERIFY (tags unlisted, the compare call failed, no
//     world named) is STALE and names the error: the sweep may well be blessed,
//     so DOWN would overstate it, but the blessing is overdue to be SEEN.
//
// PURE: the caller reads the file, the tags and GitHub's compare answer, so
// every branch below is falsifiable with no box and no network.
