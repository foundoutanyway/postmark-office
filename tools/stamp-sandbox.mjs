// stamp-sandbox.mjs — every stamp event, scripted, on a throwaway town ledger
// and a throwaway store, on a synthetic clock (POS-366).
//
// ── WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Darko, 2026-10-04: stamps are irreversible, so each stamp event is driven on
// purpose in a throwaway environment, on a compressed clock, whatever its
// real-life cadence, and nothing that touches stamps reaches prod until this is
// green. The week plan's rule: "nothing that touches stamps reaches prod until
// the stamp sandbox has run every stamp event on a throwaway store and ledger
// and come back green on that PR's own head."
//
// ── WHAT IT RUNS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node tools/stamp-sandbox.mjs [--town <town checkout>] [--keep] [--json]
//                                [--report <file>]
//
// One command, from the office tree whose head is under test. The office code
// it drives is THIS tree's (src/*-exec.mjs, the watchers, the drain, the
// ceremony, the ingests); the town engines it drives are the town checkout's
// own (tools/stamp-mint.mjs, ballot, epoch-close, the ferry), exactly the pair
// the box runs. `--town` defaults to this tree's `town-clone/`.
//
//   1. THE SANDBOX. A temp directory holding a `git clone --local` of the town
//      checkout with its remotes REMOVED (nothing can push), a fresh ed25519
//      key, and a fresh Postgres from test/helpers/embedded-store.mjs (every
//      migration, every role, its own port and data directory; WORLD2_PG_URL
//      and PG* are never read, so no run can reach the dev or prod store).
//      Both are deleted at the end unless --keep.
//   2. THE COPY OF THE LEDGER. The real ledger's history comes along, re-signed
//      line by line under the throwaway key (the seals do not move: a seal is a
//      hash of the text, the key only signs it), and the town's public key is
//      replaced by the throwaway one. So the town's own verifier checks the
//      whole real history and every sandbox line with one key. Real residents'
//      outboxes are emptied so only the script's letters cross.
//   3. THE STORE, seeded the way prod's was: the registry rows from the town's
//      two files, the stamp projection and escrow at the setup commit, and the
//      town index (town_stamps) seeded in a child process from a snapshot.
//   4. THE SCRIPT (tools/stamp-sandbox-script.mjs): synthetic residents, a
//      synthetic clock, and every stamp event, each through the code path the
//      box runs, each with its expected outcome written in the script.
//   5. THE CHECKS, after every step:
//        · the ledger is append-only (the old bytes are a prefix of the new);
//        · the seal chain: every seal recomputed, every new line's signature
//          verified with the sandbox key;
//        · conservation: the accounts sum to zero and none but MINT is negative;
//        · the step's expected outcome: new lines by kind, balance and staked
//          deltas per resident, and NO change to any resident it did not name;
//        · the store agrees with the git fold: stamp_projection (balance),
//          escrow_projection (open mark positions), town_stamps (balance,
//          mint_count, staked — added up delta by delta, never refolded), and
//          the funding tables' pot escrow;
//        · after every crossing, the town's own full verifier
//          (tools/stamp-verify.mjs: chain, signatures, replay, conservation,
//          lawful), as the box's crossing chain runs it, and once at the end.
//   6. THE REPORT: green, or red with the event and check that failed. Exit 0
//      green, 1 red, 2 when the sandbox itself could not be built.
//
// ── THE COMPARISON: GIT MINT AND STORE MINT ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The crossing's mint is the store's (POS-341: world2/tools/stamp-mint-run.mjs
// decides from the store's inputs and records its lines in stamp_lines), and
// the projections are checked against the git fold. The comparison is one more
// COMPARATOR below (`compareMints`, a function that reads the store and the
// clone after a step and returns the differences, each named): every pass of
// the store's runner is run again by the town's own `--append` on the same
// head, and the two must agree line for line. The script does not change.
//
// Node 22+. Runs anywhere the office suite runs (the embedded-postgres
// devDependency). Prints no secrets; holds none.
