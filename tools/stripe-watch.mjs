// stripe-watch — the card rail, closed at both ends by rule.
//
// usdc-watch sees and does not witness, and its header is a long argument for
// why that boundary is correct THERE. This file is the other answer, and the
// difference is not appetite — it is that the two facts which forbid
// auto-witnessing on Base are both ABSENT on the card rail. They were checked,
// not assumed:
//
// 1. THE SESSION SAYS WHICH POT. An ERC-20 transfer carries no memo, so a
//    watcher of the intake address is guessing at a stranger's intent. A Stripe
//    checkout session carries `client_reference_id`, and since site main
//    b2260e7a the town's own fund page sets it: the "Pay by card" link is
//    `${STRIPE}?client_reference_id=${pot.pot}`. Nobody types it; the PAGE the
//    payer stood on writes it. A session that does not carry one is not guessed
//    at — it is journalled as `needs-pot` and the report says so by name.
//
// 2. THERE IS NO PAYER PASTE-PATH TO FRONT-RUN. The theft this whole class of
//    watcher risks is consuming a ref's one mint chance before the patron
//    claims it (usdc-watch.mjs: "ref is unique forever: one dollar, one mint
//    chance, a re-recorded receipt bounces", and the ledger has no row kind that
//    reassigns a payer). On Base the patron HAS a paste-path, so the watcher can
//    beat them to it. On the card rail the town's own page says, in its own
//    words: "Step 2 — there isn't one … There is nothing for you to paste. The
//    hash form belongs to the USDC rail — it reads Base directly and cannot see
//    a card payment." A ref of the form `stripe:<session_id>` can therefore be
//    minted by exactly one thing in the whole town, and it is this file. There
//    is no honest claim to front-run.
//
// So the ruling law of this lane — no payment waits on a person; every arrival
// resolves by rule, and only anomalies surface — is buildable here, and this is
// where it is built.
//
// ── HOW ONE SESSION RESOLVES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   ref   `client_reference_id` is `<pot>` or, since POS-317 (Keemin, 2026-10-02),
//         `<pot>_g<id>`: the pot and the SIGNED-IN payer's GitHub account, minted
//         by the fund page so nobody types anything. The account resolves through
//         src/fund-holder.mjs to its household and to the one resident who holds
//         its stamps, and `from:` names that handle (the close reads `from:` as a
//         handle: docs/2026-10-02/rail/fund-household/measure-from.out). An account
//         no household holds is a gift under outside:stripe. A bare `<pot>` (older
//         sessions, the bare link, a signed-out payer) keeps the two channels below.
//
//   pot   the pot part of `client_reference_id`, if it names a pot the town posts AND that pot
//         is open (potGate, the /fund door's own gate). Anything else —
//         missing, unknown, draft, closed — journals as `needs-pot`. The first
//         real $10 (2026-08-25) predates the parameter and lands here; every
//         session after b2260e7a carries one, so this queue should approach
//         zero and a rising count is a signal about the page, not the watcher.
//
//   hand  TWO CHANNELS, asked in order, and only a clean answer is a hand.
//
//         FIRST, the session's custom field `handle`, if it EXACTLY names a
//         registered household (the town's own `householdKeys`, the same set
//         the /fund door's guard 3 asks). Unchanged, and first ON PURPOSE:
//         eight logins in the live pins file are also somebody's resident
//         handle today, so a pin channel asked first would let a payer typing
//         their OWN handle pay a stranger's deed.
//
//         SECOND, added 2026-08-27: a GitHub login THE TOWN HAS ALREADY PINNED
//         to a household, in its own reviewed `tools/github-ids.json`, that
//         resolves to exactly ONE current hand. The case that forced it was a
//         real $20 to darko-fund whose payer typed `herzfunke-martina` — their
//         GitHub login, bound by the town's own pins to the single-resident
//         household of `sol-am-lichterfenster`. Filed as a gift, that dollar
//         mints no holo, and the ref's one mint chance is spent forever.
//
//         This is NOT a loosening toward near-matches. A typo is still a gift;
//         the exact-match rule refuses fuzzy names and still does. It is the
//         office declining to discard a binding the town wrote down under
//         review. A PIN NAMES A HOUSEHOLD, NOT A PERSON: where the household
//         holds several hands (17 of 93 pinned logins today, six behind one of
//         them) the pin cannot say which of them paid, and choosing would be
//         the office deciding whose deed grew — so several hands is a gift, and
//         the note says THAT rather than implying a misspelling, because the
//         two are fixed by completely different acts.
//
//         The map is `src/household-logins.mjs`, which projects the town's own
//         `currentHouseholds()` plus its own pins — the same one resolver
//         `tools/world-households-export.mjs` publishes to the World, extracted
//         so there is not a second copy to drift.
//
//         Anything else — absent, misspelled, unpinned, or a login two accounts
//         claim — → the receipt's payer is `outside:stripe` and the dollars
//         count toward the pot without minting holo for anyone. That is not a
//         new rule; it is the already-published one, from the card rail's own
//         warning on the fund page: "a payment the office cannot attach to a
//         hand can still be a gift, but it cannot mint your holo."
//
//         AND IT SAYS SO ON THE ROW. The pin is the only channel that pays a
//         hand the payer did not type, so a resolution through it carries
//         `attributed_via: "login-pin"` and a note naming what was typed, what
//         it became, and on whose authority — because the grace window exists
//         for a person to veto a resolution, and one nobody can see is not
//         reviewable.
//
//         WHY THAT SPELLING. `from:` in the pot-receipt grammar is `(\S+)`, so
//         it will take anything without a space. `outside:stripe` is chosen
//         because a handle can never look like it: `isResidentHandle` admits
//         only `[a-z0-9-]`, so a colon makes the string unmintable as a name.
//         A future reader can therefore tell an unattached gift from an
//         attached one by shape alone, with no list to consult. The town's own
//         close already knows what to do with it — deriveEpochClose resolves a
//         payer that is not a household to holo 0 — the payment is recorded
//         and settled, and it mints nothing, exactly as the founding family
//         grant does.
//
//   when  one full crossing after the session was created. THE GRACE IS THE
//         POINT: while a session is held, the intake journal shows the operator
//         round the typed handle and the resolution it is ABOUT to get, so a
//         payer who typed `jetto-of-starfoge` can be fixed before the one-shot
//         ref is spent. After the window the rule runs and nothing waits.
//
//         An interpretive call, made in the open: "≥1 crossing old" could mean
//         "a crossing boundary has passed" (the town's usual sense — a letter
//         sails on the next boat) or "its age is at least one crossing". Those
//         differ sharply: the boundary reading gives a payment made at 11:59 UTC
//         a grace window of ONE MINUTE, which is not a window at all, and the
//         window is the stated reason the delay exists. So this implements
//         ELAPSED AGE ≥ CROSSING_MS — always at least twelve hours, never less.
//         The clock is the town's own ratified derivation (src/crossings.mjs),
//         not a number typed here.
//
//   cap   the town's own `intakeCheck`, through the /fund door's own
//         `fundGuards`, so D5 ("intake refuses dollars past a pot's posted
//         target, mechanically … except pots explicitly marked uncapped") is
//         one copy of one rule. An over-target arrival journals `over-cap` and
//         is NOT witnessed — the pot's headroom is real money law, and a watcher
//         is the last thing that should be allowed to walk around it.
//
//   again idempotency is the LEDGER's, not the journal's: every tick asks
//         `foldPotReceipts` whether `stripe:<id>` is already a receipt, exactly
//         as usdc-watch's `witnessed` bucket does. The journal remembers what
//         was SEEN; the ledger decides what was DONE. A journal lost to a wiped
//         disk therefore cannot cause a double-witness — it costs the operator
//         their window, and nothing else.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE, said out loud ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A REFUND AFTER THE FACT. A session is read once, at `status=complete` and
// `payment_status=paid`. If the founder refunds a card payment later, the
// receipt stands — the ledger is append-only and signature-linked and has no
// row kind that unwitnesses a dollar. Inside the grace window a refund is
// catchable by the operator round, which is one more reason the window is a
// full crossing rather than a boundary. After it, this is a known and accepted
// hole, and the honest place to fix it is the ledger's grammar, which is
// founder-only. The journal records `payment_intent` so any such dollar can be
// traced back to the charge by hand.
//
// TEST-MODE MONEY. A test-mode key returns test sessions that look exactly like
// real ones. A test payment must never become a real ledger row, so
// `livemode: false` is an anomaly (`testmode`), never a witness.
//
// ── THE SETTLED DOLLARS (POS-183, 2026-09-23) ───────────────────────────────
//
// The ledger's `usd:` is a whole number of US dollars. Until this change the
// watcher took it from `session.amount_total` and refused any session whose
// `currency` was not "usd" as `not-usd`, for the founder's hand. Account-level
// Adaptive Pricing is ON (Keemin, 2026-09-21), so Stripe may PRESENT a Payment
// Link in the payer's currency. The session's `currency` and `amount_total`
// are then the PRESENTED ones, in GBP or EUR, and every international payment
// would have landed on the anomaly list instead of on the ledger.
//
// Stripe settles every such payment to the account's currency, and the dollars
// that settled are on the charge's BALANCE TRANSACTION:
// `payment_intent → latest_charge → balance_transaction.amount`, in the
// settlement currency's minor units, GROSS (before Stripe's fee). Gross is what
// `amount_total` has always meant for a dollar session, so a dollar on the
// ledger means the same thing whichever currency the page was shown in.
//
// So, for a session presented in anything but dollars:
//
//   read   the payment intent, with `expand[]=latest_charge.balance_transaction`
//          (`readSettlement`, a second call per non-dollar session only). A
//          dollar session makes no extra call and resolves exactly as before.
//   write  `usd:` from the balance transaction, whole dollars, cents disclosed
//          as they always were. The presented currency and amount ride the
//          witnessed JOURNAL row as a receipt — `presented: { currency, amount }`
//          in Stripe's minor units — and never the ledger row, whose grammar is
//          unchanged.
//   refuse `not-usd` now means the BALANCE TRANSACTION itself is not in dollars,
//          which only an account that stopped settling to dollars can produce.
//          A session whose settlement has not been read (no charge yet, or the
//          read failed) is `unsettled`, and every tick re-reads it.
//
// The settlement is JOURNALLED (on the `seen` row, or on a `settled` row when it
// arrives later), because tools/funding-report.mjs re-decides these rows from
// the journal with no key and no network. A settlement held only in this
// process's memory would give the report and the tick two answers for one
// payment — the report would say "unsettled" over a dollar the tick witnessed.
//
// Usage: node tools/stripe-watch.mjs [--state <state.json>] [--journal <j.jsonl>]

//                   /etc/<unit>.env + systemd EnvironmentFile=, mode 600) and is

//      STRIPE_API_VERSION  optional; unset means the account's default version,

/**
 * WHOSE DOLLAR THIS IS — two channels, asked in order, pure.
 *
 * 1. THE HANDLE. An exact match against the town's registered households, the
 *    same set the /fund door's guard 3 asks. Unchanged, and it is asked FIRST
 *    and keeps its precedence: eight logins in the live pins file are also
 *    somebody's resident handle today, so if the pin channel went first, typing
 *    your own handle could pay a stranger's deed.
 *
 * 2. THE PIN. A GitHub login the TOWN HAS ALREADY BOUND to a household, in its
 *    own reviewed pins file, resolving to exactly one current hand. This is not
 *    a fuzzy match and not a search for the nearest name — the exact-match rule
 *    refuses those and still does. It is the office declining to throw away a
 *    binding the town wrote down under review. The map is built by the town's
 *    own resolver through src/household-logins.mjs, never a second one.
 *
 *    ONE HAND OR NO HAND. A pin names a HOUSEHOLD. Where that household holds
 *    several hands — 17 of 93 pinned logins today, six behind one of them — the
 *    pin cannot say which person paid, and choosing would be the office
 *    deciding whose deed grew. Several hands is a gift, and the note says so in
 *    those words rather than as a misspelling, because the two are fixed by
 *    completely different acts.
 *
 * Anything else — a typo, an unpinned login, a stranger, a login two accounts
 * claim — is a gift under OUTSIDE_FROM exactly as before. Every gift carries
 * the sentence the fund page already published: a payment the office cannot
 * attach to a hand can still be a gift, but it cannot mint your holo.
 *
 * WHY THE NOTE MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE RULE. This is the only channel that pays
 * a hand the payer did not type. The grace window exists so a person can veto a
 * resolution before the ref is spent, and a resolution nobody can see is not
 * reviewable — so an attribution through the pin says, on the row itself, which
 * string was typed, which hand it became, and on what authority.

 * THE ROWS THE CURSOR FORGOT — every session the journal remembers as SEEN and
 * has never recorded as WITNESSED.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS (postmark#2973, 2026-09-19) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A held session is journalled `seen` and decided again on the next tick only
 * while the live listing still returns it — and the listing starts at the
 * cursor, which `decide` moves to the NEWEST session it was shown. So the
 * moment a newer session shares a listing with a held one, the held one falls
 * behind the cursor and `created[gte]` never returns it again. soren's $10.28
 * to `keeping-ec2` sat that way for three days while every tick printed
 * "holding: 0" over it, because nothing re-read the journal.
 *
 * THE CURSOR IS FOR FINDING NEW SESSIONS. THE JOURNAL IS FOR REMEMBERING HELD
 * ONES. The header above already promised half of that — "the journal remembers
 * what was SEEN; the ledger decides what was DONE" — and it was true of dedupe
 * and false of re-decision. This is the other half.
 *
 * `tools/funding-report.mjs § stripeQueue` has decided from exactly this set
 * since it was written, which is why the report re-read soren's session as
 * Ready to witness on the third day while the watcher could not see it at all.
 * Nothing changes for that reader: this makes the tick agree with it rather
 * than adding a second rule beside it.
 *
 * A `refused` row STAYS in the set. A refusal spends nothing — the ref is
 * unspent and the code that wrote the row says so in those words ("the next
 * tick tries again") — so a refusal is a delay, not a verdict.
 *
 * A `witnessed` row drops OUT, and that is the point of asking the journal
 * rather than only the ledger. `resolveSession` would answer `already` for it
 * and the ledger's ref-uniqueness would bounce a second write regardless; the
 * watcher must not even try.
 *
 * Pure, and takes raw journal rows so a torn line costs nothing.
