// world-households-export.mjs — publish the town's handle → credential-household
// mapping into the World as WORLD/households.json.
//
// ONE vocabulary (ruling 9's lesson): the mapping is derived by the town's own
// resolver — stamp-mint.mjs householdKeys() over the town clone's pins
// (tools/github-ids.json) + ADDRESS logins — never by a second implementation.
// The World's fold consumes it for the parcel-claim cap (Keemin's ruling,
// 2026-07-30: at most 3 parcel claims per credential household; prior estate
// stands). A handle absent from the registry folds as its own household
// (solo:<handle>) — registry lag never blocks a new resident, it only groups
// them once the pins know them.
//
// Run: node tools/world-households-export.mjs [--town <town-clone>] [--world <world-clone>]
//      node tools/world-households-export.mjs --check    (says what would move, writes nothing)
// Writes the file only; committing and pushing the world clone is the caller's.
//
// ── WHO THE CALLER IS, CORRECTED 2026-09-09 ─────────────────────────────────
//
// This header used to say the refresh "belongs with pin churn, not on a timer"
// and is "the caller's act (founder hand or the keeper's crossing sweep)". That
// sentence named no mechanism, so nothing performed it: the file went 33 days
// without a run while `marks-fold.mjs` read it for the parcel cap,
// `mark-lint.mjs` for the consent gate, and `settlement-sweep.mjs` /
// `lane-wall.mjs` for the authorship wall — the last of which has no flag with
// which to read anything else and fails SILENTLY, standing down rather than
// refusing.
//
// THE CALLER IS THE CROSSING. `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` runs this at the start
// of every settlement, against the town clone it pinned, and commits the result
// ahead of the fold when the mapping moved. A hand-run against another town is
// still perfectly legal — that is what the flags are for — which is exactly why
// the emission stamps `town_sha` below rather than trusting its caller.

// ── THE FRESHNESS STAMP NAMES ITS OWN SOURCE ────────────────────────────────
//
// `generated_at` says WHEN this file was written and nothing at all about WHAT
// it was written from, so a reader who finds a date three days old cannot tell a
// registry that is merely unchanged from one that nobody re-derived. That is not
// hypothetical: this file sat at `2026-08-07T12:58Z` for thirty-three days while
// three consumers read it as live, and the date alone could not say so.
//
// `town_sha` is the commit of the town clone this run actually read. Resolved
// HERE, from $TOWN itself, and deliberately NOT accepted as a `--town-sha` flag:
// a stamp a caller hands in can name a different tree from the one the values
// came out of, and a stamp naming a source it did not come from is a confident
// lie rather than a missing one. The settlement chain, which is now the caller
// on every crossing, REFUSES to commit a registry whose stamp is not the sha it
// pinned (deploy/settlement-registry.mjs), so this is checked and not trusted.
//
// Null when $TOWN is not a git checkout — a fixture town, an unpacked tarball.
// Null is the honest answer there, and it is the one the chain's guard rejects.
//
// WHAT IT MEANS, because a reader will ask: the town this registry was DERIVED
// from, not the last town that was CHECKED. The crossing re-derives every time
// and rewrites this file only when the mapping itself moves, so an older
// `town_sha` means the mapping has not changed since — never that nobody looked.
// "Did anyone look" is answered on the crossing's receipt, every crossing.
