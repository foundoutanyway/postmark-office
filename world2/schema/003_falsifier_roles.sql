-- THE SECOND QUERY — WHO MAY SEE A DRAFT (023_stance_reader.sql, 2026-09-22)
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- 023 grants `stance_reader` SELECT on `claims` and adds `claims_read_stance`,
-- a policy admitting draft rows to that role. It adds NO WRITE, so the query
-- above cannot see it: `writers` filters on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE by
-- design, and a read-only role is invisible to the three-pens law — which is
-- correct, because `stance_reader` is not a fourth pen. It writes nothing.
--
-- But "who may WRITE" was the only question this file asked, and 023 makes a
-- second one load-bearing: WHO MAY SEE A DRAFT. Before 023 the answer was
-- "nobody but the owner, and 002 bars the owner from runtime" and it was a
-- fact about the shape of 007 rather than a list anyone maintained. After 023
-- it is a list of exactly one, and a list of one is a thing that grows quietly.
--
-- So it gets its own enumeration, in this file, for 007's own stated reason:
-- "Enforced structurally, not by vigilance." A second role admitted to drafts
-- by a future migration prints a row here instead of being noticed by whoever
-- next reads 007.
--
-- WHAT IT LOOKS AT: every permissive SELECT policy on `claims` whose USING
-- clause does not carry 007's household test. `claims_read` narrows itself with
-- `household = current_setting('app.household', true)`, so it admits a draft
-- only to a transaction that has declared that draft's own household — that is
-- the general rule and it is lawful for everyone. Any OTHER select policy is a
-- carve, and every carve must be on the list below.
--
-- GREEN = zero rows. This query CAN FAIL, which is the standard 003 holds
-- itself to: `CREATE POLICY anything ON claims FOR SELECT TO snapshot_reader
-- USING (true)` prints a row immediately. It is the same hole
-- `falsifier-draft-privacy.mjs --self-test` injects, caught statically.
