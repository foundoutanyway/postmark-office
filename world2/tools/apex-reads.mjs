// apex-reads.mjs — the APEX read's derivations, over Postgres rows.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (runbook § B2, P-089; the A/B report's own words):
//
//   "GET /world/apex — the whole orientation answer, and with it every A2 read
//    shadow (P-016…P-034) | P-089 | `law_projection` + a spine/reach query.
//    THE LARGEST GAP: the door's grammar is the contract the viewer speaks."
//
// Twelve `/world2/*` doors exist and `/world2/apex` is not one of them, so every
// apex read still answers out of sqlite. This is the derivation half of that
// door; `src/world2-serve.mjs` owns the queries and the render, exactly as it
// does for the live lane.
//
// ── WHAT IS PORTED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ─────────────────────────────
//
// live-reads.mjs set the rule this file obeys, and it cuts three ways:
//
//   VENDOR   a predicate that is small and exact, with its source named.
//   REUSE    a reader the office already owns as a PURE function — import it,
//            so "the projection says exactly what the door says" is literal.
//   REFUSE   a whole module's judgment. Do not approximate it.
//
// The apex read is unusual among the 2.0 doors in how much of it falls in the
// middle bucket, and that is the good news of this lane:
//
//   src/world-grants.mjs   `entriesOfClass` · `resolveGrants` · `resolveForActor`
//                          · `classOfInstance` · `scopeAdmits`. Its own header
//                          says it: "PURE. No store handle, no clone, no
//                          network — rows in, entries out. The apex owns the
//                          queries; this owns the law." So the grant law is
//                          IMPORTED here, not re-expressed. A twin of the three
//                          channels would be a second answer to who may act.
//   src/world-apex.mjs     `fieldsFor` (the field grammar), `buildTerms` (seam
//                          2), `TERMS_READING_LAW`, `DISPATCH_TOOLS`. Same
//                          reason. law-ingest.mjs already set this precedent by
//                          importing `actionEntriesOf` out of src/ — "a static
//                          in-repo import; this file ships in the office".
//
// What is PORTED here is only the part that was SQL against the hydrated sqlite
// `nodes` table and has to become a read of `law_projection` + `marks`:
//
//   `ACTION_QUERY`   + `entriesFrom`         → `classRowsFromLaw` + `entriesFromClass`
//   `RESIDUE_QUERY`  + `residueOf`           → `residueFromLaw`
//   `INSTANCE_ROWS`  + `groundClassesAt`     → `groundClassesFromMarks`
//   `gatherActions` / `gatherGroundActions`  → `gatherFromLaw`
//   `openStore().meta`                       → the window's law pin (`lawBlock`)
//
// What is REFUSED: the world ENGINE. `orient`'s containment chain and
// `openYourEyes`' field-of-view are `world-verbs.mjs` + `world-engine.mjs` —
// occlusion, fog, light, LOD ranking, distance bands. Re-expressing that here
// would be the twin the whole lane exists to avoid. Instead this file assembles
// a WORLD-SHAPED OBJECT out of Postgres rows (`worldStateFromMarkRows` +
// `skeletonFromLawRows`) and the door hands it to the engine's own functions —
// which is gold §"Phase 3" read literally: *"the engine's verbs/geometry/
// adjudication port as pure functions over queries."* The engine functions are
// ALREADY pure over a `world`; the port is the ASSEMBLY, and it is here.
//
// ⚠ THE ASSEMBLY IS LOSSY IN ONE KNOWN PLACE, and it is named rather than
// papered over: `mark.weight`. The fold computes it from the town's stamp
// ledger (`fold({ marks, terrain, stakes })` § the breadth split), and 2.0's
// `stamp_projection` is a per-HANDLE balance, not a per-mark escrow — there is
// no escrow view in the store yet (parity P-006, "RULED · claims + escrow view
// over stamp_projection", unbuilt). `lodScore` reads `weight` to rank the FOV,
// so `nearby`'s ORDER is on trial until that view exists. `worldStateFromMarkRows`
// therefore emits `weight: 0` on every mark and SAYS SO in the door's
// `disclosed` list, rather than guessing a number that would rank marks wrongly
// while looking authoritative.
//
// PURE. Rows in, values out. No pg client, no fs, no network.

 * WHICH `law_sha` an apex answer is composed at.

 * The runbook's GO says "at the window's pinned `law_sha`", and the store does
 * not quite offer that: `windows.law_sha` is written AT THE CLEARING, so the
 * OPEN window — the one a live read is taken inside — carries NULL until it
 * closes. Verified on world2_dev 2026-09-03: window 168 open, `law_sha` NULL;
 * 167 closed, pinned `cba817d7`.
 *
 * So the pin resolves in this order, and the answer SAYS which rung it used:
 *
 *   1. `--law-sha` / `?law_sha=` — an explicit ask, for the falsifier and for
 *      anyone re-reading a settled window's answer as it stood.
 *   2. the open window's own pin, when it has one.
 *   3. the most recently CLOSED window's pin — the law the last clearing was
 *      computed against, which is the newest law the store has actually ruled
 *      under.
 *   4. `projection_heads['world-law']` — the ingested head.
 *
 * Rung 3 before rung 4 is deliberate. The head is whatever the ingester last
 * pushed and may be law no window has ever cleared against; the last closed
 * window's pin is law the town has stood on. Where they differ, answering at
 * the head would show a resident affordances no settlement has ever honoured.
 * They agree today (both `cba817d7`), so this choice changes nothing now and
 * forecloses the drift — and `source` in the answer is what makes it auditable

      // mark file arrives here as the STRING" (src/world-hydrate.mjs:442-450).

      // `json_type(props,'$.ambient') = 'true'`. `law-ingest.mjs` stores
      // `recordData(m)` UNNORMALISED, so `law_projection` holds the string
      // (verified on world2_dev: `the-town/resident` and `the-town/sound`,
      // `jsonb_typeof` = `string`). A consumer that carried 1.0's boolean test
      // to the projection reads EVERY ambient class as non-ambient — which is
      // exactly what this door did on its first run: twelve resident grants at
      // every standpoint became zero.
      //
      // So the test here is the HYDRATOR'S OWN PAIR, quoted, not a widening
      // invented at this door: the same two spellings, admitted for the same
      // reason, from the same line. It is deliberately NOT truthiness —
      // `ambient: 1` / `"yes"` / `"TRUE"` still reach nothing, because
      // world-hydrate's comment is explicit that one spelling is the rule.
