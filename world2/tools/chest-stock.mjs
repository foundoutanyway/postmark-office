// chest-stock.mjs — THE FIRST STOCK OF A CHEST, at the settlement that admits it
// (WLD-27; Wright, 2026-10-12T23:59Z, 2026-10-13T00:01Z and 00:09Z).
//
// "A resident's chest mark is born at settlement. At the settlement admitting
// it, town stocking adds min(30, capacity) of that resident's label, once.
// Admission/replay must not repeatedly stock the same chest." And: "If the
// placer has NO candy label, ADMIT the chest UNSTOCKED … the receipt names
// `chest-unstocked: <handle> has no candy label` … When that resident registers
// later, stock at the NEXT settlement that finds the label, exactly once with
// the SAME replay guard."
//
// ── WHO RUNS IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `settlements-backfill.mjs --apply` on the office tick, right after the
// settlement rows and the carried rows (`stockedOnTick`, beside
// `carriedOnTick`), as `office_api` — the pen that writes `acts`. The clearing
// itself cannot: `clearing_job` holds no INSERT on `acts` (002_grants.sql). So a
// chest is stocked by the tick that first sees the settlement which admitted
// it, and the act names that settlement.
//
// ── WHY IT IS ONCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two walls, either alone sufficient:
//   1. the plan skips every chest the record already shows a `units:stock` act
//      for (world-stacks.mjs § planChestStock), and
//   2. the act carries the nonce `stock:<chest id>` under the town's own pen
//      (actor postmark-pen, household the-town), and `acts_world_nonce_once`
//      (052) is UNIQUE on (household, actor, action, nonce): a second insert —
//      a replay, a retry, two ticks racing — is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
// An unstocked admission writes NO act, so it never counts as the first stock.
//
// ── WHAT IT READS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The labels and the chest dials from the CLASS LAYER AT THE PIN (law-classes
// § LAW_AT_BLESSING_SQL: the newest settlement whose law is ingested) — the
// candy class's `labels: [{label, name, creator}]` is the one source; the
// standing chests from `marks` (data->>'class' = 'chest'); the unit acts from
// `acts`. It writes nothing but the stock acts, and never a ledger line.
