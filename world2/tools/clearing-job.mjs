// clearing-job.mjs — THE CANDLE'S CLOSE. One transaction per window.
//
// LAW (gold §1, verbatim): "The clearing's transitions are the sweep's existing
// outcomes, renamed: published → locked (materialized) · unpublished/quarantined
// → refused with the failing check named (attributable by construction; the
// isolation pass dies) · dropped/the-already-standing → refused-duplicate ·
// withdrawn → retracted · left_drafted → stays pending · rebased → ceases to
// exist (git mechanics, not a decision)."
//
// LAW (census.md Decision 2, verbatim): "Competing claims on the same ground in
// one window: neither locks; both held for REVIEW (a mind rules). Stake-weight
// is advisory context, never an auto-win."
//
// LAW (census.md seams amendment): stamp ingest runs "again as clearing_job's
// first step" at window close, then the window pins law_sha + town_sha —
// outcomes reproducible from (claims, law_sha, town_sha).
//
// LAW (Wright's ruling on the replay gate's finding 4, 2026-08-28 eve, verbatim):
// "tier is recomputed for ALL standing marks inside the clearing transaction,
// which is settlement-equivalent staleness, zero new class" — the cadence being
// 1.0's own, "derived weight moves at the next Settlement" (ECONOMY-DIALS
// read_side). That is step 7, the window's last act; the walk lives in
// standing.mjs and `falsifier-standing-equality.mjs` holds it to 1.0's fold.
//
// PEN: connects as clearing_job — the ONLY role transitioning claims,
// writing windows, and materializing marks (gold §3 rule 2). The stamp ingest
// first-step runs as law_ingester (its own pen) BEFORE this transaction; this
// tool shells to stamp-ingest.mjs for it rather than borrowing its grants.
//
// LAW (Keemin, postmark#2594, ruled 2026-09-08 and RE-RULED the same evening on
// the reviewer's measurement): the canon-absent check is NOT at this lock step.
// The crossing's own settlement pushes its mark files to origin three to four
// minutes AFTER this job clears the window — seven consecutive crossings
// measured, never once before — so a canon check here refuses the marks its own
// crossing just locked. It lives on the nightly read instead
// (`falsifier-canon-locks.mjs`, the notary rail) and becomes structurally
// impossible at the G1 swap. What DOES belong here is step 5.5: the escrow
// PRESENCE rule, which reads the town and races nothing.
//
// Usage (box):
//   node world2/tools/clearing-job.mjs --window <N> \
//     [--town-repo <checkout>]        # when given: stamp-ingest first (the census first-step)
//     [--dry-run]                     # compute + print transitions, commit nothing
//   env: WORLD2_CLEARING_URL = postgres://clearing_job:...@localhost/world2_dev
//        WORLD2_INGEST_URL   = postgres://law_ingester:... (only with --town-repo)
//
// The next window opens in the same transaction (id N+1, 12h span) — the candle
// never leaves the town without an open window.

  // 2.5 · THE PARCEL LIMITS, DECIDED AT THE CLEARING (POS-364; Darko RULED A,

  //     claim over its household's cap (the-town/claim-cap) or a resident's
  //     second parcel (the-town/one-per-resident), judged in the order the
  //     settlement judges it (first claim: marks-fold § claimInstant, world#166),
  //     is decided here as OPPOSED, citing its law, and never materializes. So
  //     it holds no ground: step 4's overlap, the 016 exclusion constraint and
  //     step 5.7's carry never see it, and another household's parcel on the
  //     same ground locks in the same window. The door still accepts every act
  //     (R11); the settlement's limit pass stays the backstop for anything this
  //     step could not judge (no world checkout, an unreadable law).
  //
  //     AHEAD OF THE GEOMETRY, which is the point of the ruling, and AFTER
  //     steps 1-2 (a duplicate or a superseded claim is not a claim on ground).
  //     The cost, named: a sibling claim refused LATER (step 3's escrow, step
  //     4's overlap, step 5's counterclaim, step 5.4's house, step 5.5's commons
  //     stake, step 6's unfileable) has already counted against its household's
  //     headroom, so a claim judged after it can be opposed that would have fit.
  //     A refused claim can be filed again; ground held by an over-limit parcel
  //     could not. ACCEPTED BY RULING: Darko, on POS-364 (2026-10-08), keeps the
  //     limits counted ahead of the ground checks with this cost named.
  //
  //     ONE RULE, NOT TWO (Wright's review of the A build). The clearing does not
  //     count: it asks the world's own fold (`parcel-cap.mjs § limitsAtClearing`)
  //     on the inputs the settlement will fold, read by the same helpers. The
  //     law at the store's pinned `projection_heads['world-law']` (the seal's
  //     law_sha, never the checkout's HEAD), each parcel dated by its first claim
  //     (`world-snapshot.mjs § firstClaimedBySlug`, a revive included, a claim
  //     with no date by its submitted_at), and the households grouped as the
  //     settlement groups them (`§ foldHouseholds`).
  //
  //     The history below is why the count is asked at the candle at all.
  //
  //     THE INSTANCE: window 191 cleared and LOCKED `mari/marigold-house-parcel`
  //     at 2026-09-15T17:45:46Z. The sweep, three minutes later, refused it —
  //     the cap counts per credential household, hers resolves to the founder's,
  //     and that one held five. The store stood the parcel while canon lacked
  //     it, and every crossing since has carried it forward as canon-absent
  //     ("CARRIED 1 canon-absent mark(s) from earlier window(s):
  //     mari/marigold-house-parcel", windows 192, 193, 194 on the box).
  //
  //     Two gates, two answers. The candle admitted what the sweep would refuse
  //     because the other steps (1-5.5) ask about slugs, supersession, escrow and
  //     geometry, and none of them counts a household's parcels.
  //
  //     THE SWEEP'S OWN CHECK IS UNTOUCHED. It stays as the gate of last resort:
  //     this side reads the store and the sweep reads the tree, and the day they
  //     disagree the conservative one is the one that should win.
  //
  //     AND IT DEGRADES LOUDLY RATHER THAN EITHER WAY SILENTLY — the same shape
  //     step 5.5 below already argues for itself. Without `--world-repo` (or with
  //     a checkout that cannot answer) the cap is reported UNCHECKED and parcel
  //     claims lock as they did before this step existed. It is not read as "the
  //     cap is 0", which would refuse every parcel in the town on a missing
  //     argument, and it is not silent: the crossing prints it and the window's
  //     receipt carries it. (If the conductor would rather the crossing REFUSE
  //     while it cannot check, that is this block's `unchecked` arm and one throw.)

  //     Step 3 above is an AFFORDABILITY test and says so — `if (total === 0)
  //     continue`. A claim staking zero has never been looked at. The 1.0 sweep
  //     is where the PRESENCE rule lives (`settlement-sweep.mjs:1146-1152`,
  //     "commons needs escrow > 0"), and G1 deletes the sketchbook path that
  //     carries it, so after the cutover the rule stops being enforced anywhere
  //     unless it is here.
  //
  //     THE CLASS IS COMPUTED, NOT READ. `marks.data.tier` is written by
  //     `recomputeStanding` at step 7, AFTER materialization — at this point the
  //     mark does not exist and the column is null, so a gate reading it would
  //     judge every claim as classless and refuse nothing, forever. The port's
  //     own walk answers prospectively over the standing rows PLUS the candidate
  //     rows, in the shape `materializeClaims` is about to insert. One definition
  //     of standing, used twice.
  //
  //     OWN GROUND IS EXEMPT WITHOUT A CLAUSE: the class rule answers `home` for
  //     a mark on its own household's ground (`mark-standing.mjs § groundVerdict`,
  //     ported in `standing.mjs`), and only `commons` needs escrow. Writing an
  //     own-ground exception here would be a second copy of a law, and copies
  //     drift.
  //
  //     AND IT DEGRADES LOUDLY RATHER THAN EITHER WAY SILENTLY. `escrow_projection`
  //     is migration 014, which arrives with lane 2 (`jetto/g1-render-stakes`);
  //     until it lands, `escrowPresenceAt` answers null and every commons claim
  //     is reported UNCHECKED and locks. It is not read as "nobody staked" —
  //     that would refuse the whole town on a missing migration — and it is not
  //     silent: the crossing prints it and the nightly read carries the class.

  //     that is this block's `if (escrow.unchecked.length)` arm and one throw.)
