// drop-provenance.mjs — A DROPPED UNIT'S MARK IS PROVED AGAINST ITS ACT (WLD-27).
//
// Wright, 2026-10-13T01:19:15Z (AUTHORITY): the World's grammar is shape-only
// — it cannot see the store — so "at settlement, in the office fold/publication
// of the dropped mark, resolve `dropped: act:<N>` from the existing act log. It
// must exist, be the unit DROP act, and match BOTH mark author/act actor and
// candy label." An unproven reference withholds ONLY that mark, named
// `dropped-unit-unproven: act <N>`; the settlement is never failed or held.
//
// The act log is `acts` and the drop is `units:drop` (world-stacks.mjs §
// UNIT_ACTION.drop), class `holding`, actor the dropper, its one move
// `{ from: <dropper>, to: null, label, n: 1 }`. No second provenance store.

 * And by lineage: a class whose chain in `classes` (standing.mjs § classLayerOf)
 * reaches candy is candy, so a kind of candy is proved as candy is.
 *
 * IN A SKEW ONLY `candy` ITSELF IS CAUGHT: when the store's pens disagree on the
 * commit, `classLayerVia` hands the clearing no layer (null), and a subclass of
