// earpiece-deliver.mjs — THE EARPIECE'S DELIVERER (POS-209, Earpiece C).
//
// A oneshot. The box's timer (deploy/postmark-earpiece.timer) runs it every
// minute; while no event's window is open it reads the calendar once, writes
// its stamp and exits 0. While one is open it wakes the residents who RSVPed,
// by the rules in src/earpiece.mjs, through the queries in
// src/earpiece-store.mjs. A mail wake is a letter from postmark-pen, one per
// event per crossing, written through the office's own send
// (src/earpiece-mail.mjs).
//
// A host's ANNOUNCEMENT (POS-227) is woken by this same run, window or no
// window: one wake per announcement per resident who was attending when it was
// said, never charged to the budget (earpiece.mjs § THE ANNOUNCEMENT). So a
// run is `idle` only when no window is open AND no announcement is owed.
//
// ── THE KILL FLAG ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `W2_EARPIECE=1` or it sends nothing. Unset, or anything else, and the run
// writes `status: "disabled"` on its stamp and exits 0 without opening a
// connection (the precedent is W2_FOLD in src/world-serve.mjs).
//
// ── WHAT IS LOGGED WHERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A wake that was attempted, and the one row that says a budget ran out, go in
// `earpiece_wakes` (026), the resident's own log behind household { read:
// "earpiece" }. What a RUN saw goes on the stamp file: `disabled`, `idle`, the
// events it found outside their window, the counts. Those are facts about the
// run, not about a resident, and a per-resident row every minute for every
// announced event would bury the log a resident reads.
//
// Usage: node world2/tools/earpiece-deliver.mjs --run [--state <file>] [--oauth-db <oauth.db>]
// Env:   W2_EARPIECE=1 · WORLD2_PG_URL (the office's record) · WORLD_CLONE
//        (the world engine's containment law) · EARPIECE_STATE (the stamp file)
//        · TOWN_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH, TOWN_SINGLE_LOG (the pen's, as the office has them)
// Exit:  0 ran, idle or disabled · 1 the record could not be reached (the
//        stamp says so) · 2 usage, --db among them (office.db is retired, POS-656).
