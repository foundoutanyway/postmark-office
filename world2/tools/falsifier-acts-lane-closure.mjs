// falsifier-acts-lane-closure.mjs — EVERY WRITE LANE REACHES `acts`, LANE BY LANE.
//
// ── THE LAW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Gold plan §1, verbatim, and it is a list rather than a principle for a reason:
//
//   "LIVE — acts: walks, says, enters/exits, throws, arena beats. Personal,
//    ephemeral, non-contested. Written synchronously by the office API."
//
// Gold plan §2, verbatim: "Events → Postgres (the office)."
//
// And the migration meta-rule, gold §3, verbatim: "every change answers WHICH
// LANE, WHICH TABLE, WHICH PEN — or it is refused."
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE falsifier-acts-parity ─────────────────────────────
//
// The parity falsifier asserts: every undrained sqlite JOURNAL row has its
// `acts` twin. That is a complete check of the lanes that write a journal row,
// and it is BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION to the lanes that do not — it iterates the
// journal, so a lane with no journal row is a lane it never asks about.
//
// That blindness is what hid the say gap. Speech is named in the first sentence
// of the LIVE lane's own definition, its pen is the voices log, it never
// touched `appendJournal`, and the standing falsifier was green the entire
// time. Two siblings were hiding in the same shadow (walk under
// WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2, and give/drop/take), and the class is not "say was
// forgotten" — it is:
//
//   A LANE IS INVISIBLE TO 2.0 UNLESS SOMETHING ASSERTS ITS CLOSURE FROM THE
//   LANE'S OWN PEN. Asserting it from the journal only ever finds the lanes
//   that were already there.
//
// So this file reads each lane's OWN store — voices-log.jsonl, `attachments`,
// `movements` — and asks whether the act reached Postgres. Different question,
// different direction, and the two together cover the whole door.
//
// ── AND THE CENSUS GUARD, WHICH IS THE PART THAT SURVIVES US ─────────────────
//
// Checks 1–3 catch today's three gaps. Check 0 catches TOMORROW's: it reads the
// apex's own dispatch table and reds if a verb appears that this file has not
// been told about. A new act cannot be added to the world without someone
// answering the meta-rule's question for it. That is the difference between
// fixing three instances and fixing the class.
//
// ── RUN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

//     --db <dynamic.db> --voices <voices-log.jsonl> [--since <ISO>]

// `--since` is the closure window's floor. Default: the open window's
// `opens_at`, which is a boundary the store itself defines rather than one this
// file invents. Acts written before the mirror was switched on are lawfully
// absent, and a falsifier that ignored that would be red forever and therefore
// read by nobody (the lesson departure 3 taught falsifier-acts-parity).
//
// Exit 0 green · exit 1 red · exit 2 CANNOT RUN — never green for a question it
// could not ask. --prove-can-fail proves each check catches a mangled input,
// touching no store.

// compares a journal's distinct classes against `CLASS_LANE_OF`. Neither of
// them reads `acts` at all.
//
// ⛔ WHY THIS MODE EXISTS, and it is a defect in the file's own shape rather
// than a convenience. The full run reaches check 0 only AFTER the usage gate
// demands `--db` and `WORLD2_PG_URL`, and prints it only after four store-bound
// checks have run. So the one question this census exists to answer on the day
// a verb lands — "does every door this office opens have a pen named for it?" —
// could not be asked on a branch, in a worktree, or anywhere without a live
// store to open. `--prove-can-fail` proves the CHECK works against synthetic
// input; it never asks the check about THIS TREE. That is the gap: a census
// that is "late by exactly the interval in which the gap can open" was, itself,
// unaskable during exactly that interval.
//
// `--db` is optional and its absence is DISCLOSED rather than counted green:
// without a journal to read, check 0b has nothing to be asked about, and a mode
// that reported "clean" for a check it did not run would be the noise floor
// hidden in the silence.
//
// ⛔ EACH CHECK'S VERDICT COMES FROM ITS OWN FINDINGS (the office-halves
// review, repair 4). The first cut of this mode pushed check 0b's findings
// into check 0's `problems` array and then printed "check 0 … RED" off its
// length — so an unruled journal class was reported as a verb-census failure
// while LANE_OF was untouched and check 0 was green. A verdict computed from a
// different source than the one it names is the freshness-stamp class.
//
// ⛔ GIVEN-BUT-UNREADABLE IS A REFUSAL, NOT "NO --db WAS GIVEN" (repair 5).
// The first cut gated on `censusDb && existsSync(censusDb)` and fell into the
// no-db disclosure otherwise, so an operator who typo'd the path got exit 0
// and a sentence blaming them for something they did do. Now a path that was
// given and cannot be read as a journal is a usage refusal — exit 2, the
// same code the full run's usage gate uses — that names the path and the

  // the store actually holds have a ruling in CLASS_LANE_OF" — and what changes
  // between the modes is which store is reachable to ask it of.
  //
  //   the FULL run   has Postgres, so the store is `acts` and the check runs
  //                  there (check 0b, below). It read the sqlite journal until
  //                  G1; after G1 that table holds the arena's rows and nothing
  //                  else, so a census over it THERE would have gone quiet
  //                  about every other class while still reporting green — the
  //                  exact failure this check exists to prevent.
  //
  //   the CENSUS     has NO POSTGRES. That is the whole of it: this mode exists
  //   (`--census`)   "to be asked on the day a verb lands, on a branch, with no
  //                  Postgres", which is why it takes `--db` and reads whatever
  //                  journal it is pointed at. Pointing it at `acts` would not
  //                  narrow this mode, it would DELETE it.
  //
  // ⚑ AN EARLIER CUT OF G1 DID DELETE IT, by moving this arm to "runs against

  // mode that has no record to reach. It cost the four tests in

  // when it was not given) and not about which table production fills.

  // what that table now holds. The question is still a real one — the arena is
  // the lane still writing there, and a new arena class nobody ruled on is
  // exactly what this catches — and the line it prints names the count AND the
