// falsifier-guard-equality.mjs — the guard on the WRITE-PATH GUARD port.
//
// `guard-reads.mjs` is a PORT of the office's own door guards onto `claims` and
// `acts`. Every function it ports forbids a second copy of itself; what stands in
// for the import is the live lane's answer, unchanged:
//
//   RUN BOTH, OVER THE SAME INPUTS, AND NAME EVERY ROW THEY DISAGREE ABOUT.
//
// Every oracle below is 1.0's OWN function, imported live out of this office —
// `liveMarks`, `liveChildrenOf`, `replayDrafts`, `readAttachments`,
// `declareAttachment`, `liveHolder`, `holdingsOf`, `attachmentsFromState`. None
// is re-expressed here.
//
// ── THE EQUALITIES, AND WHAT EACH ONE COULD CATCH ──────────────────────────
//
//   G1 THE LIVE LAYER   1.0's `liveMarks(db, {household})` against
//                       `pgLiveMarks`, over a population written through ONE
//                       `appendJournal` call per declaration — so both pens hold
//                       the same acts BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by arrangement.
//                       Catches: a dropped field, a coerced type, a status the
//                       port counts as live and 1.0 does not.
//   G2 THE THREE SEAMS  the fields that deliberately differ across the flag —
//                       `stamps`↔`stake`, `put_forward`↔`status`,
//                       `household`↔the resolved key. Each is its OWN assertion
//                       rather than an exemption in G1: a seam that is checked is
//                       narrower than a seam that is skipped, and G1's comparison
//                       stays total.
//   G3 THE CHILDREN     1.0's `liveChildrenOf` against `pgLiveChildrenOf`, over
//                       EVERY id in the live layer — the empty answers included,
//                       because the stranding check's whole job is to be empty
//                       correctly.
//   G4 THE OVERLAY      1.0's `replayDrafts` over the journal against
//                       `pgDraftsForKey`, with the SAME canon and 1.0's own
//                       `pathFor`/`filedPathOfAt` injected into both. Catches the
//                       deleted arm, which `claims` cannot answer at all.
//   G5 THE HOLDER FOLD  1.0's `attachmentsFromState` → `declareAttachment` →
//                       `readAttachments` → `liveHolder`/`holdingsOf` — the
//                       recovery chain `dynamic-rebuild.mjs` ran — against
//                       `pgAttachmentsFor` → `pgHolderOf`/`pgHoldingsOf` over
//                       `acts`. The 1.0 store on this box is EMPTY (see the
//                       module's § COVERAGE), so the oracle is rebuilt from the
//                       world repo's own STATE by 1.0's own covenant. That
//                       covenant is exactly the claim under test.
//   G6 THE RLS REFUSAL  that `assertHouseholdDeclared` refuses an undeclared
//                       connection, and — with the owner credential — HOW MANY
//                       draft rows `office_api` cannot see cross-household. This
//                       is what makes `DISCLOSURES.cross_household` a receipt
//                       instead of a claim.
//
// ── EXIT CODES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   0  every equality holds
//   1  RED — a divergence, named
//   2  CANNOT RUN

// THE POPULATION — one appendJournal call per declaration, both pens at once
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// G1–G4 need the two stores to hold THE SAME ACTS. On `world2_dev` they do not
// and cannot: its 851 locked claims are canon (they are rows in `marks`), and
// the lab office's journal holds one row. Comparing those two would be comparing
// two different questions, which is the mistake E2 made in the live lane and
// which is worth not repeating.
//
// So the population is WRITTEN.
//
// ── IT TAKES TWO WRITES NOW, AND THAT IS G1 (POS-156, 2026-09-22) ────────
//
// It used to take ONE: `appendJournal` wrote the sqlite journal row and fanned
// the same row out to the Postgres pens, so a single call filled both sides of
// the A/B and neither side was arranged. G1 deleted that journal INSERT --
// `appendJournal` writes the RECORD and only the record now -- and the one call
// stopped feeding 1.0's arm.
//
// It did not fail loudly. It filled `claims` and left the journal empty, so the
// comparison ran with a full docket against nothing and reported the port
// drawing marks "1.0's overlay does not" -- six findings and, underneath them,
// the line that actually says it: "compared nothing: G1_a, G2_a, G4_a, G1_b,
// G2_b, G4_b -- a green here is unearned".
//
// So the script writes BOTH eras explicitly, because the one function that used
// to write both no longer does. Neither side is arranged any more than it was:
// the store's row is what the live pen makes of the declaration, and the
// journal's row is `normalizeRow`'s -- the office's ONE row shape, imported
// rather than restated, so the two sides cannot drift into disagreeing about
// what a row is.
//
// ⛑ THE JOURNAL WRITE IS THIS FILE'S, and it is not a door's. No pen in the
// office writes that table any more except the arena's (`appendArenaRow`). This
// falsifier writes it because 1.0's live layer IS that table and 1.0's readers
// are the oracle it judges the port against; when those readers go (G2, with
// `liveMarks` and `draftsForKey`), this file goes with them and the two-write
// population goes too.

//   · a parcel                        → the cap guard's own kind
//   · a withdraw of a live draft      → the DELETE arm; gone from both
//   · a withdraw of a PUBLISHED mark  → the arm `claims` cannot answer (G4)
//   · a second household              → the scoping every guard depends on

// ── THE TWO SPELLINGS, WHICH THIS HARNESS MUST HOLD APART ──────────────────

// The first run of this falsifier got them wrong and said so loudly, which is
// the reason both names exist here rather than one.
//
// `JOURNAL_HOUSEHOLD` is what `resolvedWorldHousehold(key)` returns — the office
// KEY's household name, which for a one-resident key is the handle. It is what
// `appendJournal` stores, what `liveMarks(db, {household})` scopes by, and what
// `mirrorAct` copies into `acts.household`.
//
// `HOUSEHOLD_KEY` is what `householdKeyFor` resolves that name to through
// `identities` — the RESOLVED key, and what `claims.household` holds.
//
// Feeding the key to `liveMarks` and the name to `pgLiveMarks` would compare two
// different questions and report the port as holding nothing. Feeding both sides
// the key made `householdKeyFor` miss (it is keyed by HANDLE) and write
// `solo:gh:9000001` — a spelling of a spelling. Both happened on run 1, and both
// were the harness rather than the port.

// scratch seeds both below and they say the same thing — a harness that said it

    // Held out NARROWLY — only where the port has no seq and 1.0 does, which is
    // exactly the flipped-era row and nothing else. On the shadow lane both
    // sides carry the number and it is still compared, so this buys the flip
    // nothing it did not have to pay for.
    //
    // Why the port cannot have it: on a flipped lane the claim is written
    // INSIDE the pen's transaction, and the sqlite reverse-mirror row does not
    // exist yet — `appendActFlipped` inserts it only after that transaction
    // commits. So at the moment the claim is written there is no seq to carry,
    // and inventing one would need a second write to the claim after the
    // commit: the atomicity hole R1 closed, reopened to satisfy a comparison.
    //
    // And it is bookkeeping rather than a fact about the mark. 001_tables.sql
    // calls journal_seq "the shadow-era pairing key, dying at cutover", and the
    // journal itself dies with the reverse mirror — a column scheduled to stop
    // existing is not the thing to red a guard-equality run over. The act↔claim
    // pairing that DOES matter moved to `data->>'_act_id'` in the same change
    // (src/world2-claims.mjs § `_act_id`).
    //
    // WITHOUT THIS the first guard-equality run after the mark lane flips goes
    // red on every live mark, for a difference that is the flip working.
    //
    // WHAT IT COSTS, said rather than glossed: the mark shape alone cannot tell
    // a flipped-era claim from a shadow-era claim whose `_journal_seq` went
    // missing, so this also stops catching that second thing. It is a real
    // weakening of a real check, accepted knowingly — the pairing this was

    // cutover. If a narrower discriminator ever exists, tighten it.
