// falsifier-standing-equality.mjs — the guard on the port.
//
// `standing.mjs` is a PORT of 1.0's standing walk (mark-standing.mjs, plus the
// three fold-derived fields it reads), and mark-standing.mjs's own header says
// what a port costs: "One definition, five consumers … a second copy of this
// walk is a future drift; import it." The clearing job cannot import it — it
// holds no world checkout, and the stateless contract belongs to the ingesters —
// so what stands in for the import is this: run BOTH, over the same state, and
// name every slug they disagree about.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THE FOLD, not `markStanding` alone. That distinction cost the
// seed lane six rows and is written in seed-import.mjs § foldOracle:
//
//   "The first pass at the tier fix imported `markStanding` and called it on the
//    raw loader records. That was closer but still wrong, and the A/B probe kept
//    six rows red to say so. `markStanding` reads three fields the LOADER never
//    writes and the FOLD does … the fold moves all 6, and reproduces
//    `world-state.json`'s `tier` and `declared_household` on 960 of 960 marks
//    exactly."
//
// So the comparison is: the port over `marks` rows, against `foldDerivedFor`'s
// answer over a checkout — the same oracle the seed and the replay gate use.
// This is DELIBERATELY the opposite of the projection falsifier's
// shared-derivation design: there, "two derivations would make a green mean only
// 'both parsers agree'". Here two derivations are the whole point, because what
// is under test IS the second derivation.
//
// ── EXIT CODES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   0  the port and the fold agree on every slug, and the store carries it
//   1  RED — a divergence, named per slug with both values
//   2  CANNOT RUN
//
// There is no code for "checked nothing and found nothing" (the siblings' rule):
// an empty `marks`, a checkout with no register, a checkout at a state the store
// is not at, or a comparison that ended up with zero slugs in common all exit 2,
// loudly.
//
// ── TWO QUESTIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION ────────────────────────
//
//   THE WALK      does `computeStanding` over the store's rows say what the fold
//                 says over the checkout? This is the port's correctness, and it
//                 is checkable whether or not the store has been recomputed.
//   THE STORE     does the `data.tier` actually stored equal what the walk says?
//                 This is finding 4 itself — a stale value in a source column —
//                 and it is what the recompute-at-close is supposed to make
//                 permanently true.
//
// Both are reported and both are RED, because a port that is right about a store
// nobody wrote it into is not the thing that was built.
//
// ── CORRECTED 2026-08-29 · THE SAME STATE, WHICH THIS WAS NOT ASKING ─────────
//
// This falsifier ran RED live on berthillon/le-petit-berthillon — "fold says:
// market · port says: home" — and the finding was carried upward as evidence
// that the clearing job's recompute re-introduces the repaired tier defect.
// It does not. The port was right and the oracle was old.
//
// `berthillon/chez-antoine` is a 25x25 PARCEL held by solo:berthillon standing
// exactly under the shop. So the shop is `_sovereign`, the walk stops there,
// holder === house, and the verdict is `home` — the sovereignty law working.
// chez-antoine is 2.0-born: it is in the store and in NEITHER the frozen tag nor
// world main, because a mark born in 2.0 has no file for a checkout to hold. The
// fold says `market` only because it is answering about a world that predates a
// parcel a resident really holds.
//
// The rule that failed is this module's own, quoted from the top of this file:
//
//   "what stands in for the import is this: run BOTH, OVER THE SAME STATE, and
//    name every slug they disagree about"
//
// It was not running them over the same state. The store holds marks the
// checkout does not, and this file already knew that — it reports them, one per
// slug, as "store carries X, which the checkout's register does not". But it
// excused them BY MEMBERSHIP, and standing is RELATIONAL: sovereignty and
// containment are answers about the ground a mark stands on, so one store-only
// parcel re-answers every mark inside it. A slug present in BOTH sets can have
// its verdict changed by a mark present in only one. That is the case that
// slipped through, and on the live store it was 2 of 19 findings with 1 cause.
//
// THE ATTRIBUTION RULE, which is the membership exclusion made relational: a
// WALK divergence is attributable to state the oracle cannot see IF re-walking
// WITHOUT the store-only marks makes the port agree with the fold. Attributed
// divergences are reported with their cause named — never silently dropped —
// and do not turn this red. Anything that survives the removal is a real port
// defect and stays RED. It cannot launder one: the removal only takes away rows
// the checkout provably does not have, so a defect in the walk itself, or a
// mangled shared row, is untouched by it and still diverges.
//
// ── EXTENDED 2026-09-02 · THE OTHER DIRECTION, WHICH THE PARKED INGEST OPENED ─
//
// The 08-29 correction attributed divergences to STORE-only ground. The shadow
// era then created the mirror case at scale: the git ingest is PARKED by ruling
// (2026-08-31 — "the shadow writer is the store's sole pen; the v1-vs-v2 store
// diff IS the writer comparison"), so ground that enters the world by the GIT
// pen (a founder-seated parcel, a settlement-published draft) reaches the
// CHECKOUT and never the store. Standing is relational in this direction too:
// a parcel the store cannot see re-answers every mark standing on it (the
// 09-02 live case: the parcel drain's 17 seats moved seven shared slugs).
//
// So attribution is now symmetric. A WALK divergence not excused by removing
// the store-only ground is re-tried by ADDING the checkout-only ground (the
// oracle's world, expressed in rows): if the port then agrees with the fold,
// the two were answering about different worlds and the port is not what is
// wrong. Same discipline as before — attributed rows are REPORTED with their
// cause named, never dropped, and never red; anything surviving BOTH re-walks
// is a real defect of the walk and stays RED. It cannot launder one: the
// addition only supplies rows the checkout provably holds, so a mangled shared
// row or a broken walk still diverges with them present.
//
// AND THE STORE IS ASKED AGAINST THE WALK, which is what the paragraph above
// says it was always for ("does the `data.tier` actually stored equal what the
// walk says?") and not what the code did — it compared the stored value to the
// FOLD, so every attributable walk divergence was double-reported as a second,
// independent-looking store finding. Store-vs-walk needs no checkout at all and
// therefore cannot go stale, which is the right shape for finding 4: the
// recompute's whole job is to make that equality permanently true. Nothing is
// lost by the change — a port defect is still caught by THE WALK, and a stale
// store is still caught here — what is lost is one cause wearing two hats.
