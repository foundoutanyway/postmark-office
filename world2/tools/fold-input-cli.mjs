// `--world-repo` is THE CARRY'S ONE ARGUMENT (2026-09-12). Given a world
// checkout, this builds the canon register at it and the fold carries every
// standing mark canon does not hold, beside its own docket — the repair for a
// window cleared outside the sweep's timing, whose marks nothing would otherwise
// ever fold (`fold-delta.mjs`, the second term). The checkout must be at the same
// commit `--world-sha` names, and `foldDelta` refuses if it is not: an absence
// judged against another world is a carry about the wrong subject.
//
// IT IS OPTIONAL, AND THAT IS A CHOICE ABOUT THE HAND-CARRY. Making it required
// would mean a crossing whose operator carried the code and not the plumbing
// REFUSES, which turns a missing repair into a stopped town. Omitted, the fold
// is exactly what it was before this argument existed and the receipt says
// `carried_absent.checked: false` — so a zero from a run that never looked is
// never mistaken for a town whose canon is complete.
//
// `--window` is REQUIRED and it is the just-closed window's id. The usage line
// above once read `[--delta-window N]` — a flag spelled one way in a comment and
// parsed nowhere, which the reviewer caught as this lane's own recurring class:
// a value written that nothing reads. It is now the same word here and in the
// parser, and its absence refuses.
//
//   env: WORLD2_PG=1 and WORLD2_PG_URL — the pair is consumed at
//        `src/world2-acts.mjs:255` (`env.WORLD2_PG === "1" && !!env.WORLD2_PG_URL`),
//        which is the line this file's own check quotes.
//
// EXIT: 0 the store answered · 1 REFUSED, with the reason as a JSON body on
//       stdout so the receipt carries the store's own words · 2 a bad argument.
//
// ── WHY A CLI AND NOT A CALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` is POSIX sh. Lane 2's entry point
// (`world2/tools/fold-input.mjs § foldInputFromStore`) takes a live pg client
// and is async, so something has to open the connection, await it, and hand the
// shell a file. That is all this is — plus the ONE thing the shell cannot check
// for itself, below.
//
// ── THE ORDERING, WHICH IS THIS FILE'S REAL JOB ─────────────────────────────
//
// Lane 2's stakes come from `escrow_projection`, written by `stamp-ingest.mjs`
// inside the clearing's own transaction (`clearing-job.mjs:60` shells to it as
// the census first step). So the store's escrow is as-of THE SHA THE CLEARING
// INGESTED, and the crossing must read after that ingest, not beside it.
//
// The chain cannot simply pass its own freshly-fetched town sha: lane 2 refuses
// a sha the projection does not carry, so a town that moved in the seconds
// between the clearing and the crossing would refuse every crossing. And it
// must not silently fold at whatever the store happens to hold either, because
// then nothing would ever notice an ingest that had stopped running.
//
// So the store answers at ITS OWN ingested head, and this file checks that head
// against the town the chain fetched:
//
//   · the head is not in the town's history      → REFUSE. A projection ingested
//     from something that is not this town is a torn or foreign ingest, and its
//     escrow numbers are about a different world.
//   · the head is BEHIND the fetched town        → LAWFUL, and NAMED with the
//     distance. The fold is honestly as-of that sha. But an ingest that stops
//     running looks exactly like a quiet town, and `behind` climbing over
//     successive receipts is the only thing that would say so.
//   · the head equals the fetched town           → the ordinary case.
//
// `--town-sha` is therefore an INPUT TO A CHECK, not the sha folded at. The
// receipt names the store's, because after G1 the store is the escrow oracle
// (Keemin, 2026-09-08) and a receipt must name the sha the money was read at.

// the household registry moved — so HEAD is one commit past `--world-sha` on
// any crossing after a household is declared, and the fold's equality check
