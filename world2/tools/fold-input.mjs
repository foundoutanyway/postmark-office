// fold-input.mjs — everything the settlement's fold reads, from the store alone.
//
// G1: "the settlement's fold reads the store instead of the household draft
// branches, and writes the world repo as its snapshot" (the cutover plan of
// record, 2026-09-08). `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` gets the same two things from
// two git checkouts today:
//
//   the marks   from `refs/remotes/origin/draft/*`, written by the drain
//               (`settlement-sweep.mjs:328`, `:370`)
//   the stakes  from `node tools/world-stake.mjs --escrow --json` run inside a
//               FROZEN CLONE OF THE TOWN at a pinned sha
//               (`settlement-auto.sh:163` pins it, `:287` runs it)
//
// This is the one entry point that answers both from the store, so lane 3's
// chain rewrite calls one function and drops both checkouts.
//
// ── IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES, AND EACH REFUSAL NAMES ITS OWN CAUSE ─────
//
// A fold that runs on a store which cannot answer is the 2026-08-26 starving
// crossing in a new dress: a quiet green over an empty read. `settlement-auto.sh
// § WHAT CHANGED` states the rule this file obeys ("A sweep that finds no
// candidates at all … is not a quiet day, it is a starving crossing … The sweep
// now re-derives that question by a different path and REFUSES with the
// reason"). So every precondition below throws with the sha or window it wanted
// and the sentence for why, and none of them returns an empty answer.

 * The fold's stake rows — `{ tick, holder, mark, n, weight }` — from the store.
 *
 * EQUAL, ROW FOR ROW AND IN ORDER, to `world-stake.mjs --escrow --json` run in a
 * checkout of the town at `townSha`. That equality is the falsifier
 * (`test/world2-fold-input.test.mjs`) and it is what the escrow ruling rests on;
 * it is not an approximation of the town's number, it is the same number read
 * from a projection of the town's own fold.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC IS THE TOWN'S, RESTATED HERE FOR ONE REASON: the projection
 * stores the POSITION and the DIAL, not the weight, because weight is read-side
 * and a dial change must not be a data migration (see `014_escrow_projection.sql`).
 * So the read does the last step — and it does it from columns the town's own
 * `currentHouseholdOf` filled, so the only thing that could drift is this loop,
 * which is why the test compares against the town and not against a fixture.
 *
 *   weight = n + (k if this is the household's FIRST position on this mark and
 *                 the household is not the mark author's own)
 *
 * `tick: 0` is the town's own constant on every row it emits
 * (`world-stake.mjs § deriveWorldMarkWeights`); it is carried, not invented.

/**
 * The window the fold is folding at, and the shas it is folding against.

 *
 * This function never reads `stamp_projection`. It trusts the head row, and
 * `stakesFromStore` then trusts `escrow_projection` at that sha. That is sound
 * ONLY because `stamp-ingest.mjs` is the one pen for all three town projections
 * (`stamp_projection`, `town_roll`, `escrow_projection`) and writes them in ONE
 * transaction, moving `projection_heads['town']` ONCE at the end — so a head at
 * sha S is a guarantee that every projection carries S, and a head that is absent
 * or behind means none of them do. `014_escrow_projection.sql`'s header states
 * the invariant; this is the reader that depends on it. If a second pen ever
 * writes one projection without the others, or the head moves before the last
 * `INSERT`, the proxy lies and the fold reads stakes for a sha the stamps do not
 * carry — and nothing here would refuse. (Reviewer's repair 5, 2026-09-08.)
