// ledger-names.mjs — the world's ledger filenames, and what the retired ones became.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE CLASS (postmark#2894, found 2026-09-17 by the POS-104 measurement): A
// GUARD PINNED TO A FILENAME DIES AT THE NEXT RENAME AND NOTHING SAYS SO.
//
// `falsifier-live-equality.mjs`'s E6occupancy takes its ledger path from the
// frozen passage acts themselves — `payload._ledger` — which is deliberate and
// well-reasoned: "the acts name their own source, so nothing here guesses which
// file to read." The trouble is that a FROZEN record keeps the vocabulary of
// the day it was frozen. The backfilled acts say `WORLD/threshold-ledger.md`;
// that file is gone from world main; so E6 compared 0, landed in `unchecked`,
// and the WHOLE RUN exited 2 (CANNOT RUN) on any current checkout. It had been
// unable to complete for nineteen days when a lane finally ran it.
//
// The repair is not to guess and not to stop naming the source. It is to write
// the rename DOWN, dated and evidenced, so a reader that resolves a live path
// from a frozen field can map the retired spelling forward and say that it did.
//
// ── WHAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every field below was measured in a read-only clone of postmark-town/postmark-world
// on 2026-09-17, not taken from an issue body. Two of those measurements
// CORRECTED the issue that asked for this fix:
//
//   · postmark#2894 (and the POS-104 report it was filed from) dates the death
//     of the retired name to 2026-08-29 and attributes it to world `3ef755913`.
//     `3ef755913` is NOT AN ANCESTOR OF WORLD MAIN — `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
//     says no. It is the founder's vocabulary ruling ("DO NOT CALL IT CROSSING
//     RECORD. ENTEREXIT. EVERYWHERE.", 2026-08-29) and it is real, but it is not
//     the commit that removed the file from the tree this pen reads.
//
//   · The commit that actually deleted `WORLD/threshold-ledger.md` from main is
//     `2a9042d4b`, 2026-08-28 — "the passage record keeps one file, and the
//     retired twin is deleted (#2152)" — and the same commit modified
//     `WORLD/enter-exit-ledger.md`, which is the successor.
//
// THE SUCCESSOR IS PROVEN BY BYTES, NOT BY NAME. At `settlement/S50`, where both
// files still stand, they are byte-identical (both md5 bd20f9b74b7f, 185 lines).
// The world's own prose says so on both sides of the rename — before:
// "`WORLD/threshold-ledger.md` carries these same bytes for one grace window";
// after, on main: "The retired name `WORLD/threshold-ledger.md` is gone
// (2026-08-28) … there is no second file."
//
// THE CONSEQUENCE FOR AN OLD TAG IS NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Where the
// named file still exists — `settlement/S50` is the recipe's own historical
// case — the resolver returns it untouched and the pen reads exactly the bytes
// it read before. The rename is followed ONLY when the named file is absent, so
// this cannot change any verdict that was reachable before it.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not a CLI. It carries no entry guard and no tail on purpose: the roster in
// test/cli-guard.test.mjs is a live scan for entry guards, and a pure module
// belongs outside it. It lives apart from the falsifier for one reason, said
// plainly so the next reader does not mistake it for structure bought early:
// `falsifier-live-equality.mjs` parses argv, imports the checkout's tools and
// connects to Postgres at MODULE SCOPE, so importing it from a test calls
// process.exit(2) before an assertion can run. The fix had to be testable, and
// this is the smallest shape that makes it so.
