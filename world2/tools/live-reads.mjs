// live-reads.mjs — 1.0's LIVE-lane read derivations, ported to `acts` rows.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (the A/B report's gaps list, § No door, data present):
//
//   "GET /world/walkers (133 walkers) | P-092 | a positions view over
//    legacy:departure — needs AB-P3 fixed for full history"
//   "GET /world/present (132 residents) | P-093 | presence view over acts"
//   "GET /world/dynamic | P-098 | views over acts"
//   "world_occupancy | P-036 | ... an occupancy/crossings view"
//
// AB-P3 is fixed (§ The ledger backfill), so the full history is there. What was
// missing was the DERIVATION: every apex read shadow still answers from sqlite,
// and the store holds the events with nothing able to ask them a question.
//
// This is the standing lane's shape, one lane over: a PORT of 1.0's own law as
// pure functions over DB-shaped rows, held to the original by a falsifier that
// runs BOTH over the same state (`falsifier-live-equality.mjs`). The reason it
// is a port and not an import is world2-serve.mjs's: the read tier answers from
// Postgres and holds no world checkout, which is the whole direction of gold §2
// ("freshness as a QUERY, not a pipeline"). Where a predicate is small and
// exact it is VENDORED verbatim with its blob sha; where it is a whole module's
// judgment it is refused rather than approximated.

// ── THE FIVE ERAS OF A MOVEMENT ACT, WHICH IS WHERE A PORT GOES WRONG ────────
//
// `acts` holds movement rows written by five different pens, in five payload
// shapes. A derivation that reads one of them and silently drops the others is
// the AB-P3 defect all over again — a world wrong by exactly the amount nobody
// looks for. All five are read, and a shape none of them explains REFUSES.
//
// | era | how identified | payload | source of the mapping |
// |---|---|---|---|
// | `ledger` | `payload._ledger` present | already the checkout reader's own output: `{iso,handle,from,toward,at,targetExtent,targetMarkId,pace,line}` | ledger-backfill.mjs § the shape of a backfilled row |
// | `journal` | `payload.payload.from` | the whole jsonl row: `{at,type,actor,seq,payload:{from,toward,crossing,within,to,pace,line_no}}` | seed-import.mjs `deriveActs` |
// | `journal-line` | `payload.payload.lines` | a live-pen act crystallized into a crossing log: `{…,payload:{ledger,lines:[<the verbatim line>],…}}` | walk-exec / crossing-exec § SETTLE AT THE SAVE, seen through the journal envelope |
// | `live` | `payload.lines` | the live pen's own act, mirrored straight into `acts` | the same, post-cutover |
// | `movement-store` | `payload.from` with no line and no envelope | the movements row's own columns: `{from,toward,pace,within,to}`, the crossing on the ACT row | world.mjs § THE WALK GAP; the mapping is `storedDepartures`' again, one level up |
//
// **THE FIFTH ERA WAS FOUND THE SAME WAY THE FOURTH WAS** — by the refusal
// firing (2026-08-28, the write-path closure). `WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2` has been on
// since movement-v2 shipped, so EVERY walk on dev goes to `dynamic.db/movements`
// and its pen writes no ledger line at all. Those acts did not exist to be
// refused until the write-path lane mirrored them; the hour they did, this
// derivation refused every one, exactly as the last line of `departureRecordOf`
// says it should. The era was then learned deliberately rather than guessed,
// which is what that refusal is for.
//
// **THE FOURTH ERA WAS FOUND BY THE FALSIFIER, NOT BY READING.** The first cut
// of this file knew three and refused three `legacy:enter`/`legacy:exit` rows
// the replay had ingested from crossings 151–153 — vermillion entering Pando
// Peak. Those rows are the live pen's line inside the journal's envelope, and
// the refusal named them rather than dropping them, which is the whole argument
// for refusing: an era nobody knew about announced itself.
//
// The last two eras carry their LINE rather than a parse — "carried VERBATIM,
// so the save appends exactly what this pen formatted rather than re-deriving
// it" — so both are read with the vendored grammar, the same one that wrote
// them. There are ZERO bare `live` DEPARTURES on `world2_dev` today: nothing
// has walked since the mirror was switched on. That path is implemented anyway
// because cutover is the point of this lane, and a NOT-YET-EXERCISED path is
// stated as such by `departureCensus` rather than left to be discovered.
//
// ── THE ORDER, AND THE 44-HANDLE TRAP UNDER IT ──────────────────────────────
//
// "latest wins" is 1.0's whole supersession rule (`currentDeparture`: "a
// resident's CURRENT departure is their last recorded one"), and `last` means
// LAST IN ARRAY ORDER, not latest by instant. world-movement.mjs says why, and
// the sentence is law here too:
//
//   "APPENDED, NOT SORTED, and the reason is era one's own law: the walk ledger
//    is append-only and 'latest wins' means latest APPENDED — which the engine
//    implements as the last match in array order. File order and instant order
//    disagree in the real ledger (the 08-08 sailing filed every passenger at
//    18:00:00.000Z and those lines were appended after walks stamped 18:16), so
//    re-sorting here would silently re-decide which leg governs a resident."
//
// In `acts` the append order of the ROWS is not the append order of the RECORD,
// because the backfill inserted the 304 pre-journal ledger departures AFTER the
// 786 journal ones (it had to: `journalBegins` needs the journal there first).
// So `ORDER BY id` puts the oldest era last and hands a resident a walk from
// July as their governing leg.
//
// This is measured, not feared. On `world2_dev`, 2026-08-28:
//
//   plain `id` order            44 of 73 handles get a DIFFERENT governing departure
//   era-then-id vs by-instant    0 of 73
//   journal era, id vs instant   0 of 72 (786 of 786 rows monotone in `at`)
//
// So the order is ERA FIRST — and inside the non-ledger era, THE INSTANT, then
// row id. `DEPARTURE_ORDER_SQL` is that clause and the endpoints use it;
// `departureRecords` asserts it was applied rather than trusting the caller.
//
// ── THE INSTANT KEY (ruled 2026-09-21, POS-154) ─────────────────────────────
//
// "A departure's order is its INSTANT, never its insertion id." The same order
// the runbook's D6 replay already uses for the holding rows (`at, id`,
// POS-153/162) — one law, not a new one.
//
// WHAT FORCED IT. `acts` held no departure between 2026-08-27T09:57:00.374Z and
// 2026-08-31T03:35:20.069Z; 438 walks lived only in `dynamic.db/movements`, and
// `acts.id` is `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` with that window's ids long spent
// on the 729 other acts that DID land there. A backfilled row can therefore
// only be APPENDED, above every walk September filed — and under `id` alone
// that made an 08-29 walk the governing record for the 41 of 52 actors in the
// gap who have walked since. No guard could see it: the rows ARE id-ascending.
//
// WHY IT IS SAFE. A no-op on the record as it stands, measured twice, in two
// eras: the `world2_dev` table above (era-then-id vs by-instant, 0 of 73), and
// POS-154 over prod's 2,397 non-ledger departure acts — zero instant inversions
// among 2,396 adjacent id-ascending pairs, zero governing departures moved.
//
// WHY THE `CASE`. The ledger era keeps `acts.id` alone, because it is the one
// era whose file order is genuinely not its instants: the 08-08 sailing filed
// every passenger at 18:00:00.000Z and those lines were appended after walks
// stamped 18:16. Sorting that era by instant would silently re-decide which leg
// governs a resident — the exact harm this whole section exists to prevent, in
// the other direction. `world2-live-reads.test.mjs § latest wins is LAST IN
// ARRAY ORDER` is that case, and it stays green because of the `CASE`.
//
// ONE OWNER. The keys below are the single description of this order: the SQL
// clause is built from their `sql`, and `assertDepartureOrder` is driven by
// their `of`. A second copy of an ordering is how a guard comes to bless an
// order the query never asked for.
//
// ── WHAT IS **NOT** HERE, AND WHY (the honest list) ─────────────────────────
//
//  1. THE FRAME / CARRIER OVERLAY (Stage D). `positions.mjs § withFrames` moves
//     a resident aboard a carrier to the carrier's position, and
//     `dynamic-presence.mjs` warns what its absence costs: "`present` would put
//     a passenger back on the quay they left". It cannot be ported: the fold
//     needs `world-frames.mjs foldFrames` + the vessel timetable + the
//     `movements` table, and NONE of those has a 2.0 surface. `aboard` is
//     therefore absent from every answer here rather than present-and-false —
//     a field that is always false is a lie with a schema. `DISCLOSURES.frames`
//     is what the doors say instead.
//  2. `standing` / `era` / `ledger_moved`. All three are facts about the sqlite
//     `entities` table and its refresh cadence. 2.0 has no crystallization to be
//     stale against — `positionsAt` derives at the instant asked, always — so
//     the staleness vocabulary has nothing to describe and is not invented.
//  3. THE LIVE SOUND LANE. `presentEmissionsAt` reads `legacy:emission` acts,
//     which are the crossing-save's crystallized emissions. The LIVE say path
//     writes no journal row at all (`world.mjs` calls `appendJournal` for
//     leave-mark, amend and withdraw only), so it is not mirrored, so `acts`
//     receives nothing said since the seed. This is a WRITE-path gap, named
//     here because a read tier that answered "silence" would be indistinguishable
//     from a quiet town.

 * picked:
 *
 *   PER-ACT   each emission's own stamped `props.radius_m`. Gold §3 rule 2's
 *             per-act determinism, and the reason `recordEmission` stamps it:
 *             "a dial changed tomorrow does not retroactively re-govern what
 *             happened today." Every historical emission then keeps the earshot
 *             it was actually heard at.
 *   CURRENT   one dial for the whole answer, which is what `voices.mjs
 *             heardBy` does today: `distM(point, ear) <= earshotM` with
 *             `earshotM = EARSHOT_M`, the class mark's live value.
 *
 * They differ the moment `the-town/sound`'s `radius_m` moves — and it HAS moved
 * (`class_version` runs 1 → 2 across the seeded rows). Neither reading is
 * obviously wrong: 1.0's live ear uses the current dial, 1.0's own emission row
 * argues for the stamped one. `mode` says which was applied, on every answer.
