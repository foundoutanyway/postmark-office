// mark-render.mjs — a `marks` row → the `mark.md` bytes the drain would write.
//
// G1 makes the store the only source: the settlement's fold reads the store
// instead of the household draft branches, and writes the world repo as its
// snapshot. Today those files come from `src/world-drain.mjs:411`, which calls
// `markRecord(u.fileRec, u.body)` with a fileRec built out of a JOURNAL row's
// payload (`world-drain.mjs:231`). This is the same call with the same
// serializer, fed from a store row instead — so the grammar has ONE writer
// still, which is the whole point of `src/mark-record.mjs` existing:
//
//   "Two copies of a serialization is how two eras come to disagree about the
//    bytes of the same declaration — and the disagreement would be invisible,
//    because both would parse."
//
// So this file maps ROWS TO A RECORD and serializes with the door's own
// function. It never formats a field itself.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT REPRODUCE, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN ───────
//
// The brief this was built to assumed byte-equality against the tree was a
// property of the mapping. It is not, and the tree is why. Measured against
// world `66da7f97` (settlement/S62), 1,182 mark files:
//
//   · 75 DISTINCT FRONTMATTER FIELD ORDERS, `by` before `kind` in some eras and
//     after it in others.
//   · 40+ distinct frontmatter keys. `RECORD_FIELDS` — the door's grammar — is
//     13. On disk: `pre` 506, `derived_from` 506, `tier` 472, `mechanic_draft`
//     101, `source` 182, `version` 158, `dials` 157, `implements` 154 …
//   · KEY ORDER INSIDE `at` AND `extent`, which jsonb does not keep. 510 files
//     write `extent: { w, h }` and 36 write `{ h, w }`; 545 write `at: { x, y }`
//     and one writes `{ y, x }` (rei/the-latecomers-circle, 2026-09-03 — the
//     door wrote back what the resident sent).
//   · TWO VALUE FORMS FOR ONE RING. Of 22 files carrying `points`, 3 are in
//     `fmtVal`'s JSON-array form (`[[x,y],…]`, all written since 2026-08-27) and
//     19 in the older `x,y x,y` hand form, which `parseDeltaRecord` still READS
//     and `markRecord` has never WRITTEN. This one was found by the test's own
//     unknown-class guard after the header had already been written claiming two
//     classes — the guard reddened on the third within the hour.
//
// None of that is the store's fault and none of it is reachable: the door
// REFUSES the extra fields today (`RECORD_FIELDS`'s note on `tier`: "standing is
// derived from the ground your mark stands on, never asserted by the author"),
// and jsonb has no key order to return. Two of those keys became reachable on
// 2026-09-08/09 by ruling, because a crossing DOES write them for the town's
// own marks: `tier` is emitted for the one value the walk reads from a file
// (`constitution`; `src/mark-record.mjs § EMITS`, the reader's predicate quoted
// there) and `version` is written last. The key order lived on the tree side
// (world PR #23 normalised the 36 `{ h, w }` files). So the honest claim is the
// narrow one, and it is the one G1 needs:
//
//   A MARK A CROSSING WRITES renders byte-identical from the store.
//
// A mark no crossing touches keeps the bytes it already has, because the fold
// writes what it publishes and leaves the rest of the tree alone
// (`world-drain.mjs § writeDownHousehold` builds its tree from the base). The
// falsifier is `test/world2-mark-render.test.mjs` and the equality it runs is
// over the crossing's own set, not over the corpus — a corpus-wide equality
// would be a check nobody could ever make green, which is a check that gets
// turned off.
//
// ── THE TWO CONVENTIONS, NAMED SO THEY CAN BE ARGUED WITH ────────────────────
//
//   `at`     → `{ x, y }`      545 of 546 on disk; `world-drain.test.mjs:348`'s
//   `extent` → `{ w, h }`      reference literal is `at: { x: 7, y: -3 },
//                              extent: { w: 6, h: 6 }`, and that literal is
//                              deliberately not another call to `markRecord`
//                              (its own comment says so), which makes it the
//                              closest thing this office has to a written
//                              record grammar.
//
// ── THE FRAME, AND IT IS THE FIELD MOST LIKELY TO BE GOT WRONG ───────────────
//
// `geometry.at` is WORLD coordinates; the FILE speaks its parent's frame.
// seed-import.mjs § the frame note: "`at` is already WORLD coordinates —
// `loadMarks` composed the v3 frame. The file's own numbers stay behind in
// `_fileAt`, deliberately." So the file's `at` is `data._fileAt` where the
// parser left one, and `geometry.at` only where it did not — which is exactly
// the root-level marks, whose two frames are the same. 503 rows carry
// `_fileAt`; the 46 that do not are the door's own, all of them root-level.
// Reading `geometry.at` unconditionally would put world coordinates into a
// relative-framed file — the 2026-08-27T01:13Z pando-peak defect, which
// `world-drain.mjs § fileFramer` exists to prevent on the journal side.
