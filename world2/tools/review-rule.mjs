// review-rule.mjs — THE VERB `held_review` NEVER HAD. One transaction per ruling.
//
// LAW (census.md Decision 2, verbatim): "Competing claims on the same ground in
// one window: neither locks; both held for REVIEW (a mind rules). Stake-weight
// is advisory context, never an auto-win."
//
// `clearing-job.mjs` step 5 puts claims into `held_review`. Until this file
// nothing took them out: the one state in the six-count that no pen could move,
// so a contested parcel sat on a closed window's docket forever wearing a status
// that promised a decision nobody could record. A state a system can enter and
// never leave is not a lifecycle stage — it is a hole with a name.
//
// ── WHY AN OPERATOR TOOL AND NOT A DOOR ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three reasons, and the first one is the substrate refusing:
//
//   1. THE PEN. Transitioning a claim is `clearing_job`'s grant and nobody
//      else's (002_grants.sql), and `claims_update_guard` exempts exactly that
//      role: "office_api's claims UPDATE is retraction only". An endpoint served
//      by `office_api` could not do this if it wanted to, and giving the door
//      the clearing pen so that it could would hand the candle's whole authority
//      to the surface with the widest attack area.
//   2. IT IS NOT A RESIDENT VERB. A resident cannot rule their own contest, and
//      a resident cannot rule someone else's. There is no grant in
//      `law_projection` for it and there should not be: the sixteen grants are
//      what the law affords residents, and "settle a contest between two
//      residents" is the office's act, in the lane the census already names
//      REVIEW.
//   3. THE PRECEDENT IS IN THIS DIRECTORY. `world2/tools/README.md` § The pens:
//      "The REVIEW lane — 'a mind clears it' — lives entirely in the GitHub PR
//      flow, where a grant widening is visible in a diff. Nothing in this
//      directory decides anything." That sentence is about LAW review, and this
//      is the CLAIMS half of the same lane: a mind decides, and the tool only
//      records what the mind decided. Every judgement here comes in on the
//      command line — `--by`, `--rule`, `--because` — and this file computes
//      none of it.
//
// A keyed endpoint was considered and refused for reason 1: it would need the
// clearing credential to exist behind the office's HTTP surface at all times, in
// exchange for saving a mind one ssh.
//
// ── WHY THE RULING MATERIALIZES RATHER THAN RE-DOCKETING ────────────────────
//
// The obvious cheaper design is to put the winner back to `pending` in the open
// window and let the ordinary candle lock it. It is wrong, and the reason is
// worth keeping: a claim's escrow sufficiency was judged at ITS window's
// `town_sha` (step 3), and re-pending it would have the next candle re-judge it
// at a different one. The candle would then be able to REFUSE a claim a mind had
// already granted — stake-weight overturning the mind, which is the exact thing
// Decision 2's last sentence forbids. A mind's ruling is terminal by law, so it
// is terminal here.
//
// What it does NOT get to do is rule on a world that has moved. Between the hold
// and the ruling another window may have locked the slug or the ground, so both
// checks are re-run at ruling time — and a failure REFUSES THE RUN rather than
// refusing the claim. A mind ruled on facts that have changed; that wants the
// mind again, not this tool's guess.
//
// ── THE MATERIALIZATION IS THE CANDLE'S OWN ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `materialize.mjs`, imported — the same `materializeClaims` and
// `recomputeStanding` `clearing-job.mjs` steps 6 and 7 call, extracted rather
// than copied. A mark that arrives by a ruling and a mark that arrives by the
// candle are the same row by construction. The standing recompute is not
// optional here: granted ground moves a neighbour's tier exactly as a clearing's
// does, and skipping it would re-open the replay gate's finding 4 through the
// side door.
//
// ── THE ACT, AND THE ONE SEAM THIS TOOL CANNOT CLOSE ────────────────────────
//
// A ruling is a deed the town did, so it takes a row in `acts` — where the
// notary exports it to public git and anyone can read that a mind ruled, who,
// and why. But `acts` INSERT belongs to `office_api` (002_grants.sql) and this
// tool holds `clearing_job`; the roles falsifier exists precisely to red when a
// fourth writer appears, so granting `clearing_job` an acts INSERT is a law-tier
// change and NOT this lane's to make unilaterally. It is teed instead.
//
// So the run is ORDERED, not atomic: the ruling transaction commits first, then
// the act is written on a second connection. The ordering is chosen so that the
// failure mode is recoverable — `acts` is append-only, so an act for a ruling
// that then rolled back could never be taken out again, while a ruling whose act
// did not land is fully recorded in `claims.ruling` and `windows.receipts` and
// can have its act written afterwards. `--journal-only` is that repair, and it
// refuses to write a second act for a ruling that already has one.
//
// ── THE SECOND DOOR, AND WHY IT NAMES RATHER THAN REFUSES (postmark#2594) ───
//
// Keemin ruled on 2026-09-08: "a claim that would lock while the mark it
// materializes has no file on main at the locking crossing is REFUSED at the
// clearing job's lock step" — and WITHDREW that lock-time refusal the same
// evening, when the reviewer measured the settlement's push landing minutes
// AFTER the candle clears (`canon-register.mjs`'s header carries the table).
// Nothing at the candle reads canon now. What survives of the ruling here is
// the door: this file is the OTHER lawful writer of `marks` — it writes
// `status = 'locked'` and calls the same `materializeClaims` — so a mind
// granting a contest can materialize a mark canon does not carry, and no
// candle step ever saw or sees it.
//
// A GUARD HERE WOULD BE THE WRONG SHAPE, and that is a judgement the lane made
// and the conductor took (2026-09-08): a mind ruling on a contest is a
// deliberate act by somebody who can read canon for themselves, and the ruling
// covers the candle. What was missing is not a refusal — it is the FACT. So this
// prints one line when the granted claim's slug has no canon file, and the mind
// rules with it in front of them.
//
// AND IT NAMES ITS OWN ABSENCE. Without `--world-repo` the line says the check
// did not run, rather than printing nothing: "asked and found nothing" and
// "never asked" must not look alike, which is the whole of what #2594 is about.
// The nightly read (`falsifier-canon-locks.mjs`) catches whatever comes through
// this door regardless, because it walks standing marks and does not care which
// door they arrived by.
//

//
//   `grant`  the named claim locks and materializes; every other claim in its
//            contest is refused, naming the ruling.
//   `refuse` the named claim and its whole contest are refused. Nothing stands.
//   `hold`   nothing transitions. The ruling is recorded on every claim in the
//            contest so the record shows a mind looked and deferred — a held
//            claim with no ruling and a held claim a mind has deliberately left
//            held are different facts, and the docket should be able to say
//            which.

 *
 * `household` is NULL for the same shape of reason: a mind rules as the REVIEW

 * nothing to say about a ruling.
 *
 * `payload.at` IS THE RULING'S IDENTITY, and it is here because the closure
 * falsifier's first live run needed it. A contest can be ruled more than once —
 * `hold` today, `refuse` next week — and both are real deeds that belong in an
 * append-only log. Without the ruling instant on the row, "the act for this
 * claim" is not a question with one answer, and the check either forbids a

 * key has to be an identity.
 *
 * NO `journal_seq`: migration 025 dropped the column, and this INSERT kept
 * naming it, so every act failed until POS-405. test/review-rule-act.test.mjs
