//   EXIT: 0 sound · 1 a DIFFERENCE (each named) · 2 cannot run (no store, no 054, no snapshot)
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, in order, every one naming what it found:
//   1. THE DIGESTS (src/world-snapshot.mjs § checkSnapshot): each mark and register
//      version hashes to its digest, each list to its digest, the header to its
//      digest. A second computation in JS of what the seal computed in SQL.
//   2. THE STORE (§ compareToStore), for the NEWEST snapshot: every standing mark and
//      every register row in the store is in the snapshot with the same bytes. A
//      dropped one reds and is named. Exact right after the clearing; the review
//      lane, marks-ingest, retire-unpublished and the registry's own doors write
//      between clearings, so a later run that differs says whether the store has
//      moved since.
//   3. THE WORLD, with --world-repo, DERIVED FROM THE SNAPSHOT'S SOURCES ALONE
//      (POS-410, Darko 2026-10-05): the marks' versions, the register at the seal,
//      the ledger position, the law and terrain at law_sha, and the marks in the
//      order derived from their filings (src/world-filing-order.mjs). The git
//      reads are at law_sha: the engine's code, the freeze manifest and the tree's
//      filings. Then, for the newest snapshot, the same fold over the store's own
//      standing rows (the office's read, real uuids). Then THE SETTLEMENT: the same
//      sources with the words standing at the seal (069 stance_through, POS-362),
//      against the cached fold (the office keeps the settlement); and the fold
//      before the words against a --published file (git's printout reads no
//      words, POS-364/365). Folds are compared VALUE-EQUAL, as canonical JSON
//      (keys sorted, every array in order; Wright, 2026-10-05). jsonb keeps no key
//      order, so a key order is never a difference, and an array order always is.
//      A difference names its first key, and says when only an order differs.
